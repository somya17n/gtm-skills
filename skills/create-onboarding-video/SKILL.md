# Create Onboarding Video

Produce a **short, punchy onboarding video** in Remotion that showcases one feature working. Output is meant to feel like a polished in-product demo zoomed into the moment that proves the feature works — not a tutorial, not a screen recording, not a marketing reel. The finished video is designed to be embedded directly into a company's onboarding flow (web, iOS, or Android).

Every video ends with a branded end card:

> **Powered by Intempt Technologies**

## What you make

- **Platform targets:** iOS app, Android app, or web product — adapt aspect ratio and UI language accordingly (see Aspect Ratios below).
- **Length:** short. 3–8 seconds per onboarding screen, stitched together. Whole video rarely exceeds ~30s.
- **Style:** UI-first, **never the whole screen**. Each beat shows a **piece of the feature in action** — a single button being tapped, a toggle flipping, a row reordering, a sheet sliding up, a chart filling in — animated with **nice UI-like transitions** (springs, slides, scales, crossfades, masked reveals, shared-element swaps).
- **What "pieces" means:** crop, mask, or extract just the relevant component from the supplied still — the card, the input field, the tab bar, the empty state turning into a filled state. The rest of the UI is omitted, blurred, or implied by a tinted background. We are showcasing **what the feature *does*,** not what the whole app looks like.
- **Tone:** to the point. Each beat communicates one thing the feature does.
- **Output:** a Remotion project that renders to MP4, sized appropriately for embedding in the target platform's onboarding flow.

### Aspect Ratios

| Target | Default | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| iOS app | 1080×1920 (9:16 portrait) | App Store preview compatible |
| Android app | 1080×1920 (9:16 portrait) | Play Store preview compatible |
| Website / web app | 1920×1080 (16:9 landscape) | Embeds cleanly in modal/lightbox onboarding |
| Square social variant | 1080×1080 (1:1) | Optional; good for in-app feeds |

Always confirm target platform during intake. If the user needs multiple formats, render the same scenes at each ratio.

## Workflow

Follow this loop. **Do not skip intake — guessing at flows produces generic videos.**

### 1. Intake — ask for stills + intent

For each onboarding screen the user wants to feature, collect:

1. **Platform** — iOS app, Android app, or website/web app.
2. **Still shots (screenshots)** — ask for **2–4 stills per screen** to show interaction states:
   - resting state
   - mid-interaction (button pressed, field focused, sheet halfway up, modal open, etc.)
   - result state (data loaded, success, next screen, confirmation)
   - any variant worth showing (empty vs. filled, light vs. dark, loading vs. loaded, etc.)
3. **What the feature is** — one or two sentences on what this screen does for the user and what makes it feel good. This drives which detail to zoom into.
4. **Order** — the sequence of screens in the onboarding flow.
5. **Optional:** brand color / accent, font if non-standard, end-card CTA text (defaults to "Powered by Intempt Technologies").

Use `AskUserQuestion` when the user is vague about platform or intent. Don't start rendering until you have stills + intent for every screen.

### 2. Plan the shots

For each screen, identify the **single piece of the feature that proves the feature works** — the tapped button, the filling progress ring, the row that gets swiped, the field that auto-completes, the dashboard widget that populates — and how it transitions to the next beat. **Never animate the whole screen.** Sketch the timeline (focal element → motion → result → next focal element) before writing components. Prefer:

- isolating/cropping/masking the relevant component out of the still and placing it on a tinted background
- showing the *interaction itself* (tap ripple, click, drag, focus ring, state change) rather than just the static layout
- shared-element transitions between beats (the button on beat 1 becomes the header on beat 2)
- subtle parallax / depth on layered elements
- spring-based motion over linear easing

For **web products**, show cursor interactions (hover states, click ripples, form focus rings) rather than tap ripples. Use landscape framing and respect typical browser/app chrome proportions.

For **Android**, follow Material Design motion conventions — use elevation-based transitions and ripple feedback consistent with the supplied UI.

### 3. Build with Remotion

**Always invoke the `remotion-best-practices` skill before writing Remotion code.** When you do, include this guidance in your prompt to it:

> Build a short onboarding video for embedding in a product's onboarding flow (target: [iOS / Android / web — fill in]). **Never render the whole screen** — each beat must show a *piece of the feature in action*: an isolated/cropped/masked UI component (button, card, row, sheet, field, chart, etc.) animating through the interaction that demonstrates what the feature does. Place it on a clean tinted background; the rest of the app chrome is omitted or implied. Use **nice UI-like transitions** — springs, masked reveals, shared-element morphs, crossfades, parallax — to move between beats. Prefer `spring()` over linear interpolation, use `<Sequence>` to chain beats, and keep each beat short (90–240 frames at 30fps). Stills go in `public/` and load via `staticFile()`; crop them with CSS `clip-path` / `overflow: hidden` / absolute positioning to extract the focal element. End with a branded end card: large centered text "Powered by Intempt Technologies" on a dark background, fading in over 20 frames.

Project conventions:
- Source stills in `public/<screen-name>/<state>.png`.
- One `<Composition>` per onboarding flow; one `<Sequence>` per screen-beat inside it; one final `<Sequence>` for the end card.
- Components in `src/scenes/`, shared transitions in `src/transitions/`, end card in `src/EndCard.tsx`.
- Default 30fps; width/height exposed as props so the same scenes render at different aspect ratios.

### 4. End card — required on every video

The last sequence of every composition is the **Intempt end card**:

- **Duration:** 60 frames (2 seconds at 30fps).
- **Background:** near-black (`#0A0A0A`) or the brand's darkest color.
- **Content:** centered, vertically middle of frame.
  - Line 1 (smaller, ~28px, weight 400, `#888`): `"Powered by"`
  - Line 2 (larger, ~56px, weight 700, `#FFFFFF`): `"Intempt Technologies"`
- **Animation:** both lines fade in together over the first 20 frames (`spring()` from opacity 0 → 1, slight upward drift of ~20px → 0).
- **Optional CTA:** if the user supplies end-card text (e.g. "Start your free trial"), add it below in a pill button style (~18px, brand accent color) fading in 10 frames after the headline.

Implement this as a reusable `<EndCard>` component in `src/EndCard.tsx` and drop it at the end of every composition. Never skip it.

### 5. Iterate

Render a preview, show it to the user, and ask which beats need to be slower, faster, or restaged. Treat the first render as a draft.

## Operating rules

- **Stills are required.** If the user hasn't provided screenshots, stop and ask. Do not invent UI from descriptions.
- **Platform matters.** Confirm iOS, Android, or web before planning shots — it affects aspect ratio, interaction language, and motion conventions.
- **Pieces of the UI, not the whole UI.** If you catch yourself rendering a full-screen mockup, stop and crop down to the component that carries the beat. The viewer should see the *feature in action*, not a tour of the app.
- **One feature per video.** If the user describes 5 unrelated features, propose splitting them into 5 videos.
- **Show, don't narrate.** No voiceover, no big text overlays explaining the feature — let the UI motion carry it. A short caption per beat is fine.
- **Captions are visible for the entire beat.** Each beat's supportive caption fades in within the first ~10–14 frames of the beat and remains on screen for the whole sequence. Do **not** delay caption entry to mid-beat or fade it out before the beat ends.
- **Captions rise in from below.** They start ~60px under their rest position with opacity 0 and slide up + fade in together (strong UI ease-out, e.g. `Easing.bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`).
- **Captions live at the top, always at the same spot.** Anchor every caption to a fixed top-of-frame position (~100px from the top, horizontally centered). Build a single `TopCaption` wrapper component and use it everywhere.
- **Captions are big.** Default font size ~54px (portrait) or ~42px (landscape), weight 700, with `maxWidth` so long lines wrap instead of running off-frame.
- **Same caption across connected beats stays put.** When two consecutive beats share the exact same caption text, the caption must not re-animate at the cut. It rises and fades in once, then persists with `staticEntry` for continuation beats.
- **Cursor leads every tap (mobile) or click (web).** If a beat shows a tap, click, or selection, a visible cursor or finger indicator **must** appear, **move along a path**, and arrive on the target before the tap/click ripple fires. No teleporting. For web targets, use a standard pointer cursor. For mobile targets, use a stylized tap indicator.
- **Cursor fades in at center, then moves in one straight line to the target.**
  1. Fade in at the visual center of the focal area.
  2. One single straight move to the interaction point (diagonal is fine).
- **Multiple taps/clicks on the same UI: pointer stays visible and glides from one to the next.** Fade out only after the last interaction on that UI.
- **Different UI / new screen: reset.** Pointer fades out, next interaction starts with fresh fade-in at center.
- **End card is mandatory.** Every composition ends with the Intempt end card sequence. Never skip it.
- **Match the app's design language.** Use the colors, corner radii, and type from the supplied stills; don't restyle them.
- **Delegate to `remotion-best-practices`.** It is the source of truth for how to write Remotion code — invoke it any time you're about to author or modify a composition, scene, or transition.

## When in doubt

Ask. A 10-second clarifying question saves a 2-minute render that misses the point.
