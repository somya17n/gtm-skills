name: automation-review
description: "Reviews another loop's proposed change before it reaches a human, trying to refute it rather than confirm it - checking sample size, input freshness, whether the gate could actually have failed, and whether this exact change was already tried and reverted. Use as the second half of every loop that proposes an action. Boundary: `automation-design` specifies a loop before it runs. This skill reviews one specific proposal a loop already produced, and its default verdict is reject."

# The Loop Auditor

The checker in a maker-checker pair. The run that proposed a change is the worst possible judge of it, so this skill starts from the assumption the proposal is wrong and looks for the reason. It approves only what survives.

Default to reject. A proposal that cannot be verified is rejected, not passed along with a caveat - a caveat in a queue of twenty proposals is read as approval.

> **Loop discipline.** Read `references/loop-cadence-guide.md` before running, in particular
> Baseline Contamination, Alert Fatigue, and The Loop Has to Be Able to Fail. When reviewing a proposal, check whether the loop's own baseline has drifted: a proposal generated from a contaminated baseline is refutable on that ground alone, regardless of how sound its reasoning looks.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
This skill is standalone by design: ask inline for what it needs rather than reading a context file.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Two things that would otherwise make this checker unusable.**
>
> - **A missing ledger caps the standard; it does not reject the proposal.** If no ledger exists, a
>   first run, or a user who never ran `automation-ledger`, the history check cannot pass, and rejecting
>   on that ground means nothing is ever approved and the ledger is never created. The deadlock is
>   permanent. Instead write the history check as `unverifiable: no ledger exists yet`, apply every
>   other check at full strength, lower the tier for anything irreversible, and record the verdict so
>   the next run has something to check against.
> - **The audit must not run inside the proposing context.** The whole premise is that the run which
>   produced a proposal is the worst judge of it, and that protection is lost when the same session does
>   both, the audit inherits the framing, the assumptions, and the reason the proposal looked right.
>   Run this in a fresh context with only the five listed inputs and no access to the proposing run's
>   reasoning. If that is not possible, say so in the output: the verdict is then a self-review and
>   should be labelled one, because an unlabelled self-review is the failure this skill exists to
>   prevent.

## How to run

1. **The proposal**, in full, from whichever loop produced it, including the numbers it was based on.
2. **The gate** that was supposedly evaluated, as it was written in the loop specification.
3. **The inputs** the proposing run used, including their dates and row counts.
4. **The ledger**, for prior attempts at this same change, reverts, and overrides.
5. **What the change would cost if wrong** - dollars, and whether it is reversible. An irreversible change gets a stricter standard.

## Method

1. **Check the gate could have failed.** Re-evaluate it against the same inputs. A gate that evaluates true for every possible input is not a gate, and any proposal resting on one is rejected outright. This is the single most common defect and it is invisible from inside the proposing run.
2. **Check the input freshness and row count.** A proposal built on a stale export or a truncated file is rejected regardless of how sound its reasoning looks. Reasoning quality cannot compensate for a wrong input.
3. **Check the sample supports the claim.** Name the minimum that would, and reject where the sample sits below it. Percentages on tiny denominators are the most persuasive wrong output an agent produces.
4. **Check the ledger for prior attempts.** If this change was applied and reverted before, reject and cite the revert. If it was overridden by the user before, reject and cite the override. Re-proposing a rejected change is how a loop erodes the user's trust in the whole pack.
5. **Look for the alternative explanation.** State at least one other cause that fits the same numbers. If an alternative fits at least as well, the proposal is not yet actionable - downgrade it to an observation. A single explanation that fits is not evidence when a second one fits equally.
6. **Check the proposal against its own stated limits.** Does it exceed a budget ceiling, a per-change cap, or a window? Does it act on data the loop was told not to act on? A loop violating its own specification is rejected without further review.
7. **Check for the missing-data substitution.** Did the proposing run treat an absent value as zero, or fill a gap with an assumption presented as measured? This is the failure the ecommerce skills' withholding rules exist to prevent, and a proposal that broke one of them is rejected.
8. **Scale the standard to the cost of being wrong.** An irreversible or expensive change requires the sample minimum, fresh inputs, no fitting alternative explanation, and no prior revert. A cheap reversible change can pass on fresh inputs and a sound gate alone.
9. **Return a verdict, not a discussion**: approve, downgrade to observation, or reject with the specific defect named. Never return "approve with reservations."
10. **Append the verdict to the ledger**, including rejections and their reason. A rejection that is not recorded will be re-proposed on the next run.

## Output format

**Verdict:** approve, downgrade to observation, or reject. One line.

**Defect found:** the specific reason, naming which check failed. Empty only on approve.

**Check results**

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Gate could have failed | | |
| Inputs fresh and complete | | |
| Sample supports the claim | | |
| No prior revert or override | | |
| No better alternative explanation | | |
| Within the loop's own limits | | |
| No missing data treated as zero | | |

**Alternative explanation:** the competing cause, and whether it fits better, as well, or worse.

**Standard applied:** which tier, based on the cost of being wrong and reversibility.

**If rejected, what would make this approvable:** the specific missing evidence, so the next run can clear it.

## Rules

- Default to reject. Approve only what passes every check at the applied standard.
- Never return "approve with reservations." Downgrade to observation instead.
- Never approve a proposal whose gate could not have evaluated false.
- Never approve on stale or truncated inputs, however sound the reasoning.
- Never approve a change previously applied and reverted, or previously overridden, without citing it and requiring new evidence.
- Never approve a proposal that treated missing data as zero.
- Never approve a proposal that violates its own loop's stated ceiling, cap, or window.
- Never let the proposing run's confidence substitute for evidence.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:
- Where no ledger exists, is the history check written as `unverifiable: no ledger exists yet` with
  every other check applied at full strength, rather than rejecting on the absence?
- Was this audit run in a context separate from the proposing run, and if not, is the verdict labelled
  a self-review?

- The gate was independently re-evaluated, not taken on trust.
- Input dates and row counts were checked and stated.
- A sample minimum was named, not just asserted as sufficient.
- The ledger was checked for prior reverts and overrides.
- At least one alternative explanation was stated and weighed.
- The standard applied matches the cost and reversibility of the change.
- The verdict is one of exactly three, with no hedged fourth option.
- The verdict, including rejections and reasons, was appended to the ledger.

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.

and a stale export is caught by its own timestamp rather than by whoever remembers, which is what makes
maker-checker hold up when nobody is watching the loop.
