description: "Designs the lead-to-opportunity layer between marketing and sales: MQL scoring model, routing rules, speed-to-lead SLAs, and lifecycle stage definitions. Use when leads aren't reaching sales fast enough, marketing and sales disagree on what counts as qualified, or handoff is undefined. Boundary: opportunity-scoring scores one opportunity; pipeline-review reports on the whole pipeline; this skill is the layer before either exists."

# The Routing Engine

Design the system that moves a lead from first touch to a working opportunity: scoring, routing, and the SLA that keeps it from going cold.

> **Boundary:** `opportunity-scoring` scores a single opportunity that already exists. `pipeline-review` reports on the health of the whole pipeline. This skill covers the layer before either: lead lifecycle stages, MQL definition, and the marketing-to-sales handoff. For the actual round-robin/territory/score-threshold assignment logic once a lead is qualified, use `lead-routing`.

> **Speed to lead.** Read the **Speed to Lead** section of `references/revenue-lifecycle.md` before
> designing the SLA. Under 5 minutes carries roughly 100x the odds of qualifying against 30 minutes,
> and about 74% of businesses miss that window entirely, so this is not a subtle optimisation.
>
> Three design consequences: set the SLA in **minutes and measure from lead creation, not assignment**,
> because measuring from assignment hides the delay that matters. Instrument **two clocks** , 
> creation-to-assignment and assignment-to-first-touch, and report them separately, since routing delay
> is named by ~29% of organisations as a major cause and a perfect rep SLA fails if the lead sits
> unassigned. And define the escalation when the SLA is missed: an SLA with no escalation is a target,
> not an agreement. Writing it down is itself the intervention, ~54.9% of companies with a defined SLA
> respond within 15 minutes against ~29.5% without one.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
Check `.agents/product-context.md` first so you never ask for something already recorded there.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Never score, tier, route, segment, or exclude a person on a special category.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/agent-security.md`. Read it and follow it.


> **Map both funnels before optimising either.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/funnel-benchmarks.md`. Read it and follow it.


> **Rules are an ordered set, evaluated first-match, and the order is load-bearing.** Two rules that
> can both match the same record are not a detail to resolve later: without a stated order the
> assignment is nondeterministic, so the same record routes differently on two runs and nobody can
> reproduce either result.
>
> - **Number the rules and evaluate in sequence, stopping at the first match.** Do not present them as
>   an unordered list or a lookup table.
> - **Say why the order is what it is.** The order encodes the tie-break, so a reader who does not know
>   the reasoning will reorder it during the next edit and change behaviour without meaning to.
> - **Every record must match exactly one rule.** Where two rules genuinely overlap, either narrow one
>   or state which wins - never leave both eligible.
> - **A catch-all final rule is mandatory**, covering everything that matched nothing. A record falling
>   off the end of a ruleset is the failure nobody notices, because it produces no error and no
>   assignment.
> - Never invent a tie-break at evaluation time. If the sequence does not resolve a case, the ruleset is
>   incomplete and that is the finding.

## Context

1. Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing, ask the user to run `product-context` first, or ask inline for the lifecycle stages, ICP, and scoring definitions.
2. Read `.agents/product-context.md` for the lifecycle stages, ICP, and scoring definitions. Any input below that these already cover is usually recorded there: pull it and confirm with the user rather than asking them to restate it.

## How to run

Ask the user for:
1. **GTM motion**: product-led, sales-led, or hybrid (this changes which stages even apply)
2. **Average contract value and sales cycle length**
3. **Current stack**: CRM, marketing automation, scheduling tool, if any
4. **Current lead volume per month and where the process breaks today**: leads not getting worked, no shared definition of "qualified," slow response time, deals stuck at handoff
5. **Any existing scoring or routing rules already in place**: don't propose from scratch if something usable already exists; audit and fix it instead

## Process

1. Pick the lifecycle stages that fit their motion. A PLG motion may skip MQL/SQL in favor of product-qualified-lead signals (activation events, usage thresholds). Don't force stages that don't apply.
2. Build the MQL definition on two axes, never one alone:
   - **Fit**: does this contact match the ICP (company size, industry, role, tech stack)?
   - **Engagement**: have they shown buying intent (pricing page visits, demo request, repeat visits, product usage)?
   A perfect-fit contact with zero engagement is not an MQL. High engagement with zero fit isn't either. A student downloading every ebook is not a lead.
3. Assign point values to fit and engagement signals, set a threshold (typically 50-80 on a 100-point scale; see the reference file for a worked example), and include negative scoring (competitor domains, personal/student email, unsubscribes) so low-quality volume can't inflate the number.
4. Design routing: pick round-robin, territory-based, account-based, or skill-based based on team structure, and always define a fallback owner. An unassigned lead is a lost lead.
5. Set the speed-to-lead SLA using the benchmark curve in the reference file: response time is the single largest lever on conversion, more than fit quality in the first hour.
6. Name every handoff point (marketing→SDR, SDR→AE) with an explicit response-time SLA and an escalation path for misses.
7. If the user's breakage is post-opportunity (deals stalling, going stale in a stage, or needing non-standard terms approved), apply the pipeline stage hygiene rules and deal desk approval tiers from the reference file: required fields per stage, stale-deal flagging, stage-skip detection, and a discount-depth-to-approver table calibrated to their actual deal size distribution.
8. If the user wants a metrics dashboard, build the three-view structure from the reference file (rep / sales manager / executive): each view gets its own grain and its own metrics, never one dashboard trying to serve all three audiences.

## Output format

**Lifecycle stage table**: stage, entry criteria, exit criteria, owner

**MQL scoring model**: fit attributes + point values, engagement attributes + point values, negative signals, threshold

**Routing rules**: method chosen and why, decision tree, fallback owner

**SLA document**: response-time target per handoff point, escalation path for misses

**Pipeline stage hygiene** (only if the breakage is post-opportunity): required fields per stage, stale-deal threshold, stage-skip flags, close-date discipline rule

**Deal desk approval tiers** (only if discount/non-standard-terms approval is the actual problem): the discount-depth-to-approver table, calibrated to their real numbers, plus the exception-tracking rule

**Three-view dashboard spec** (only if requested): rep view, sales manager view, executive view, each with its own metrics and grain, not one dashboard serving all three

**Metrics to track**: lead-to-MQL rate, MQL-to-SQL rate, speed-to-lead, each against the benchmark range in the reference file, so the user knows if their number is actually healthy or just familiar

If the user named a specific breakage ("leads sit for 2 days before anyone touches them," "a rep needs approval on a 35% discount," "a deal has been stuck in one stage for 40 days"), lead the output with the fix for that exact problem before the full system design. Don't bury the urgent fix under a complete rebuild, and don't output sections the user's stated problem doesn't call for.

Read `references/revenue-lifecycle.md` for MQL scoring benchmarks, routing decision logic, and the speed-to-lead conversion curve before proposing numbers.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:
- Does every record match exactly one rule, with a mandatory catch-all final rule for anything that
  matched nothing?

- Is the MQL model built on both fit and engagement, never one alone?
- Does the scoring model include negative signals so low-quality volume can't inflate the score?
- Does every handoff point have a named response-time SLA and an escalation path for misses?
- If the user named a specific breakage, does the output lead with the fix for that exact problem before the full system design?
- Are benchmark numbers (SLA curve, MQL threshold range) pulled from `references/revenue-lifecycle.md`, not invented?

If any check fails, fix the relevant section before returning. Do not return a draft that fails a check.
