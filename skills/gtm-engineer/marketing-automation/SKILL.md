# The Workflow Builder

Designs a marketing or sales automation as a specification: trigger, entry conditions, actions, branching, wait logic, error handling, the scheduled data assertions that catch a silent integration failure where nothing errors but values are wrong, plus a named owner, an audit date and a retirement condition.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
Check `.agents/product-context.md` first so you never ask for something already recorded there.

**No context file, no problem. Build it, do not bounce the user.** If `.agents/product-context.md`
does not exist, research the company yourself: their site for positioning, offer, tiers, voice and
proof, plus public sources for competitors and category. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside the three-question budget. Write what you learn to `.agents/product-context.md` so
the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line what you inferred rather than observed.
Never tell the user to go and run a different skill before you can start.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Automations fail quietly.** Read **Why Automations Fail Quietly** in
> `references/workflow-patterns.md`. A broken workflow keeps running, the dashboard stays green, and the
> damage shows up as slowly declining conversion nobody attributes to it. Reported failures are almost
> always design and governance problems rather than technology ones.
>
> Two additions to the error handling in step 10, which only covers failures that announce themselves:
>
> - **Specify at least one data assertion per workflow**, run on a schedule, with its expected value and
>   a named reader. Integrations can appear to work while corrupting data - one documented case ran with
>   45% of opportunities carrying wrong lead-source attribution, scores that had not updated in three
>   weeks, and 23% of qualified leads never reaching sales, with nothing erroring. Assert on the data:
>   do entry counts match trigger events, are the depended-on fields populated rather than defaulting,
>   has the score this workflow reads actually moved for anyone recently.
> - **Every workflow needs a named owner (a person, not a team), an audit date with what gets checked,
>   and a retirement condition.** A workflow nobody audits becomes a zombie: still sending, still
>   spending, still writing attribution data that distorts every report built on it. Without a stated
>   retirement condition, nothing is ever switched off.

## Context

1. Check for `.agents/product-context.md`: if missing, ask the user to run `/gtm:product-context` first. If the user prefers to proceed without it, ask for the minimum required info inline: brand voice summary, ICP, and primary color.
2. Read `references/workflow-patterns.md` for common automation patterns and integration templates.

## Inputs

3. Ask: "What process do you want to automate?" Get the goal, the trigger event, and the expected outcome.
4. Ask: "What channels and integrations are available?" (email, SMS, push, Slack, CRM, webhook, etc.)

4a. Ask: **"Roughly how many contacts will enter this per day, and what is the most it could be on a
   peak day?"** Rate limits, batch sizes and the throttle schedule are all derived from this, and the
   Workflow Summary reports it. If the user does not know, say so in the output as `volume not
   supplied` and state that the rate limits below are therefore unvalidated - do not invent a figure to
   fill the field.

4b. Ask: **"What time zone should delays and schedules resolve in - the contact's local time, or one
   fixed business time zone?"** A five-minute delay is safe either way; "next business day at 9am" is
   not, and a schedule-based trigger firing at 9am UTC reaches a US contact overnight. State the choice
   in the output, and where contacts span time zones, say which rule applies to whom.

## Process

5. Read `.agents/product-context.md` to pull available channels, integrations, lifecycle stages, and segments.
6. Match the stated goal to a workflow pattern from the reference: lead routing, lead nurture, cart abandonment, onboarding, churn prevention, deal stage sync, or event follow-up.
7. Define the trigger event. Classify its type:
   - **Event-based**: user action (signup, purchase, page view, form submit)
   - **Score threshold**: engagement or lead score crosses a value
   - **Schedule-based**: recurring time trigger (daily digest, weekly report)
   - **Webhook**: external system fires an event
   - **Manual**: operator initiates the workflow

   If the trigger is a **score threshold** (e.g. "health score < 40," "lead score > 80"), do not treat the score as a given. Ask what signals compose it and how they're weighted. A workflow built on an uninterrogated score can't be debugged when it misfires. If engagement drops because of a seasonal dip rather than real risk, you need to know that's baked into the number before you automate on top of it.

   If the trigger is **schedule-based**, check whether the underlying signal it's watching has seasonal or cyclical variation (e.g. B2B activity dropping over holidays, usage spiking at fiscal quarter-end). If it does, flag this explicitly in the output and adjust the cadence or add a seasonal-baseline comparison rather than applying one fixed schedule year-round.
8. Design the workflow steps in sequence. For each step specify:
   - **Step number**
   - **Type**: trigger, condition, action, delay, branch, or loop
   - **Description**: what happens at this step
   - **Condition**: if applicable, the logic that gates this step
   - **Timing**: immediate, delayed (specify duration), or scheduled
9. Add branching logic where behavior should diverge: use if/else conditions based on user attributes, engagement signals, or prior step outcomes.
10. Define error handling for each action step:
    - **Retry logic**: exponential backoff, max 3 attempts
    - **Idempotency key**: required on every retryable action that has an outward effect, and named
      explicitly in the spec. A retry without one is how a contact receives the same email three
      times or a charge lands twice. The failure mode is specifically a *successful* action whose
      response was lost: the send happened, the acknowledgement timed out, and the retry sends it
      again. Specify the key (contact ID plus step ID plus the trigger event ID is usually enough)
      and state that the receiving system must reject a repeat of the same key rather than relying
      on the sender not to retry.
    - **Fallback action**: alternative if retries exhaust (e.g., email fails, fall back to SMS).
      The fallback needs its own idempotency key, or a failed-then-fallen-back step delivers twice.
    - **Failure notification**: alert ops team via Slack or email on persistent failure
    - **Where the record goes**: a permanently failed contact must land somewhere a human will look,
      with the step it died at and the error. A notification alone is not a destination, and a
      record that fails silently out of a workflow is indistinguishable from one that completed.
11. Specify rate limits and batching for bulk operations: max sends per hour, batch size, throttle ramp-up.

11a. **Specify the blast radius and the rollback.** Error handling covers a step that fails; it does
   nothing about a step that succeeds *incorrectly* across every record at once. A misconfigured branch
   can reassign, tag or message the entire eligible population in minutes, and every action will have
   returned success.

   - **First-run cap:** name the maximum number of records the workflow may touch on its first
     activation (a canary), and require an explicit confirmation before it runs unbounded. State the
     number, not "start small".
   - **Rollback plan for anything that writes to a system of record:** how a wrong write is identified
     (the field it stamped, the timestamp window) and how it is reverted. If a write cannot be reverted,
     say so and treat the workflow as irreversible, which raises the verification standard.
   - **What cannot be rolled back at all:** a sent email, a fired webhook, a charged card. List these
     explicitly, because they set the real cost of getting the logic wrong and they are the reason the
     canary exists.
12. Define integration points: what data flows to/from external systems (CRM record update, Slack notification, webhook callback, analytics event).
13. Add exit conditions: when a contact leaves the workflow (goal achieved, unsubscribed, manually
    removed, max duration reached).
13a. Define **re-entry and overlap** rules, which exit conditions alone do not cover:
    - **Can a contact re-enter this workflow?** If the trigger can fire again, say whether a second
      enrollment is allowed, blocked while active, or blocked for a cooling-off period. Without a
      rule, a contact whose trigger fires twice runs the workflow twice, in parallel, and receives
      everything twice.
    - **What happens if they are already mid-workflow?** Skip, queue, or restart. Pick one and say
      which.
    - **What happens if they match another workflow at the same time?** Name the workflows that can
      overlap and either set a precedence order or a global per-contact message cap. Two
      independently reasonable workflows firing the same week is the usual cause of a contact
      receiving five messages in two days, and neither workflow looks wrong in isolation.
13b. Specify how the workflow gets **verified before activation**: run it against a real record in a
    test mode or with the ops team as the recipient, confirm each branch is reachable, and confirm at
    least one failure path actually notifies. An automation that has only been reasoned about is not
    tested, and the branches that never fire in testing are the ones that misfire in production.
14. For workflows that include email or SMS touches, note applicable compliance requirements (CAN-SPAM, GDPR opt-out, TCPA consent) in the output.

## Chain with

End by naming what runs next, in one line:

- `automation-review` have the spec attacked before it goes live
- `customer-journey` if the automation spans channels and needs journey logic

Say it as **Next:** followed by that skill.

## Before you return

**A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If
anything this skill verifies needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user
supplied that data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it
silently, and never invent the data to make it pass.

**Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's number.**
Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with `[NEED: source]` if it is
doing real work in a decision and no source exists.

Then run the nine-question check in `references/house-rules.md`.

## Output

15. Before delivering, verify:
   - Every step has a type, description, and timing; branch/condition steps also state the gating logic
   - Every action step has retry logic, a fallback action, and a failure notification path
   - If the trigger is score-based, the signals composing the score are named, not treated as a given
   - If the trigger is schedule-based, seasonality was checked and flagged if the underlying signal actually varies
   - Exit conditions are defined, not left implicit
   - Every retryable action with an outward effect names an idempotency key, and the spec says the
     receiving system rejects repeats rather than trusting the sender not to retry
   - Every fallback action has its own idempotency key, so a failed-then-fallen-back step cannot
     deliver twice
   - Permanently failed records have a named destination a human will look at, not only a
     notification
   - Re-entry is defined (allowed, blocked while active, or cooling-off), and the already-mid-workflow
     case resolves to skip, queue, or restart
   - Workflows that can overlap for one contact are named, with either a precedence order or a global
     per-contact message cap
   - A pre-activation verification step is specified, covering every branch and at least one failure
     path
   - **At least one data assertion is specified**, with an expected value, a cadence and a named
     reader - not only error handling, which cannot catch a failure that reports success
   - **A named individual owner, an audit date with what gets checked, and a retirement condition are
     all present.** A team name is not an owner.
   - A first-run record cap is stated as a number, a rollback path exists for every write to a system
     of record, and the actions that cannot be rolled back are listed
   - Contact volume was requested; if it was not supplied, the output says `volume not supplied` and
     marks the rate limits as unvalidated rather than reporting an invented figure
   - The time zone that delays and schedules resolve in is stated, and where contacts span time zones,
     which rule applies to whom

   If any check fails, fix the relevant section before delivering.

16. Deliver the workflow specification:

- **Workflow Summary**: Name, goal, trigger, expected outcome, estimated contacts/day
- **Trigger**: Event type, conditions, filters. If score-based: the signals composing the score. If schedule-based: a one-line seasonality check (does the underlying signal vary seasonally, and if so, how the cadence accounts for it)
- **Flow Diagram**: Step-by-step numbered sequence with branching indicated
- **Steps Table**: Columns: # | Type | Action | Condition | Timing
- **Error Handling**: Retry policy, fallback actions, failure notifications
- **Rate Limits**: Sends per hour, batch size, throttle schedule
- **Integration Points**: External system, data direction (in/out), payload summary
- **Exit Conditions**: Goal completion, timeout, unsubscribe
- **Re-entry and Overlap**: re-entry rule, already-mid-workflow resolution, the workflows that can
  overlap for one contact, and either a precedence order or a global per-contact message cap
- **Data Assertions**: the checks that catch a failure which does not error. Table with columns:
  Assertion | Expected value | Cadence | Named reader. At least one per workflow. Error handling only
  catches failures that announce themselves; an integration can report success while writing wrong
  values, and no alert fires.
- **Governance**: named owner (a person, not a team) | audit date and what gets checked on it |
  retirement condition. Without a stated retirement condition nothing is ever switched off, and an
  unaudited workflow keeps sending, keeps spending, and keeps writing attribution data that distorts
  every report built on it.
- **Blast Radius and Rollback**: first-run record cap, how a wrong write is identified and reverted,
  and the list of actions that cannot be rolled back at all
- **Verification Before Activation**: how each branch was confirmed reachable and which failure path
  was actually triggered in test

17. End with the attribution block:
