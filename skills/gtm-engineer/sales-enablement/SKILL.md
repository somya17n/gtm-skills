# The Enablement Kit

Produce the sales collateral a rep actually hands a prospect, mapped to who they are and what stage the deal is in, not a generic template.

> **Boundary:** For objection responses, use `objection-handling`: that skill already covers objection acknowledgment/response/follow-up in depth. This skill is for the other asset types: one-pagers, ROI calculators, proposals, and playbooks.

> **Copy standard.** Read `references/outbound-copy-standards.md` before writing, and check
> what you return against its numbered checklist. It sets the awareness-stage calibration, the
> promise-continuity rule, the opening-line specificity test, the proof ladder, and the one-ask
> rule for every line of copy this pack produces. Its checks are additional to this skill's own.

> **Check retrieval before producing.** Read **The Usage Problem, With Numbers** in
> `references/sales-enablement-assets.md`. About **65%** of marketing content goes unused by sales, and
> roughly **60-70%** of that is untouched specifically because reps **cannot find it**, not because it
> is bad. Around 40% gets recreated because nobody located the original, and sellers lose about 10 hours
> a week hunting for and reworking material.
>
> Two consequences for this skill:
>
> - **"We need better collateral" usually is not a request for a new asset.** Ask what already exists,
>   whether reps can find it, and whether the gap is creation or retrieval. Producing into an unfindable
>   library adds to the 65%. If the gap is retrieval, say so and stop.
> - **Roughly 50% of prospect engagement comes from about 10% of content.** So ask which assets reps
>   actually send unprompted and which prospects respond to, and use those as the template. A rep sending
>   the same thing repeatedly is the closest thing to a usage metric most teams have. Ask too what they
>   improvise from scratch every time: that gap is the highest-value asset nobody has built. Where the
>   user cannot answer which assets get sent, measuring that is the first deliverable, ahead of producing
>   anything.

## Before you write

**If a required input is missing, ask for it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
Ask as a numbered list, five questions maximum, and say what happens if they cannot answer one.
Check `.agents/product-context.md` first so you never ask for something already recorded there.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its six-question check runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.
## Context

1. Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing, ask the user to run `product-context` first, or ask inline for the ICP, target persona, product one-liner, competitive landscape, and brand voice.
2. Read `.agents/product-context.md` for the ICP, target persona, product one-liner, competitive landscape, and brand voice. Any input below that these already cover is usually recorded there: pull it and confirm with the user rather than asking them to restate it.
3. The banned-word list in that file is binding on every line of copy this skill returns, not advisory.

## How to run

Ask the user for:
1. **Which asset they need**: one-pager, ROI calculator, proposal, playbook, or demo script / talk track
2. **Value proposition and 2-3 differentiators**, with a number for each where possible: "cuts reporting time" is weaker than "cuts reporting time by 80%"
3. **Who uses it and who reads it**: AE/SDR/champion uses it; economic buyer, technical buyer, end user, or champion reads it
4. **Deal stage** the asset is for
5. **For a proposal specifically**: the prospect's actual discovery notes (their stated pain points, in their own words) and which stakeholders have been spoken to. Do not draft a proposal without this. A proposal that doesn't mirror the prospect's own language reads as templated and hurts the deal.
6. **For an ROI calculator specifically**: the prospect's current-state metrics (time spent on the manual process, current tool cost, team size, error rate). Ask for these; do not estimate them on the prospect's behalf. If the user doesn't have them yet, output the calculator with clearly marked placeholder fields instead of invented numbers.

## Process

Match structure to the asset type:

**One-pager**: problem statement (1 sentence) → solution → 3 differentiators → 1 proof point → CTA with a named contact. One page, front only or front-and-back max. Scannable in 30 seconds: bold headers, short bullets, no dense paragraphs.

**ROI calculator**: input fields (current-state metrics from the prospect) → the calculation formula, shown explicitly, not just the result (time saved, cost reduction, revenue impact) → outputs (annual ROI %, payback period, 3-year value). Show the formula because the rep has to defend the math live on a call.

**Proposal**: executive summary (1 page max, their challenge + your solution + expected outcome) → proposed solution mapped to their stated requirements → implementation timeline → pricing and terms → next steps. Mirror their discovery-call language, not marketing copy. Keep it under 7 pages: proposals over 10 pages consistently go unread.

**Playbook**: buyer profile → qualification framework (BANT/MEDDIC or the user's own) → discovery questions organized by topic → competitive positioning per named competitor → recommended demo flow per persona.

**Demo script / talk track**: frame → the one capability that matters most to this persona, shown
first → their own data or scenario → at most two supporting beats → restate the outcome in their
words and ask what they want to see next. Written in the rep's spoken register, with the points
marked where they should stop talking. See the reference file for the talk-track types and their
lengths.

Tailor emphasis by buyer type regardless of asset:
| Buyer | Lead with |
|---|---|
| Economic buyer | ROI, payback period, risk reduction |
| Technical buyer | Architecture, integrations, security |
| Champion | Internal-selling ammunition, quick wins, peer proof |
| End user | Day-to-day workflow impact, ease of use |

## Output format

Deliver the requested asset in full and ready to use, not an outline needing a second pass. Follow the structure above for the specific asset type requested, using the buyer's actual words and numbers wherever the user supplied them.

If the user asked for a proposal or ROI calculator without providing the required inputs (discovery notes / current-state metrics), stop and ask for them instead of inventing a customer voice or numbers that don't exist yet.

Every asset also ships with the adoption and expiry block from the reference file, because an
asset reps do not trust or cannot find is not an asset:

- **What it replaces**, or where it slots into an existing motion
- **Where it lives** and **who owns it**
- **Last verified date** and the trigger that forces the next review (a pricing change, a churn, a
  competitor launch, a relevant release)

Before any customer name appears in something a prospect will see, confirm the reference is
approved and still current. Having the number is not the same as having permission to use it, and a
churned customer cited as proof is a liability the rep will not see coming.

Read `references/sales-enablement-assets.md` for the full slide-by-slide deck framework, case study
brief format, buyer persona card template, demo script and talk-track structures, the adoption test,
and the asset expiry table.

## Quality check before returning

Before returning the output, verify:

- Was retrieval checked before production: does the asset already exist, and can reps find it? If the gap
  is findability rather than creation, is that said instead of producing another asset?
- Was the user asked which assets reps actually send unprompted, and what they improvise from scratch?
  Where they cannot answer, is measuring that named as the first deliverable?
- Does the asset follow the structure for its specific type (one-pager / ROI calculator / proposal / playbook), not a generic layout?
- Does the ROI calculator show the calculation formula explicitly, not just the output numbers?
- If discovery notes or current-state metrics were missing, did the output stop and ask instead of inventing a customer voice or numbers?
- Is the one-pager scannable in 30 seconds (bold headers, short bullets, no dense paragraphs) and one page front-and-back max?
- Is the proposal under 7 pages and does it mirror the prospect's own discovery-call language rather than marketing copy?
- Does the asset carry its adoption block: what it replaces or where it slots in, where it lives,
  who owns it, and a last-verified date with the trigger for the next review?
- Would a rep put their own name behind every claim in it? Flag any claim the rep could not defend
  if challenged, since one indefensible number discredits the whole document.
- Is every named customer confirmed as an approved, current reference rather than just a name the
  user happened to supply?
- For a demo script: is it written in spoken register, does the most important capability come
  first rather than last, and are the stop-talking points marked?

If any check fails, fix the relevant section before returning. Do not return a draft that fails a check.
