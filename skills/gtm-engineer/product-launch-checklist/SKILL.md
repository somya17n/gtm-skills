name: product-launch-checklist
description: "Runs a one-time go/no-go readiness check before a product or campaign launch, covering stock, page, tracking, lifecycle flows, support, and margin as a checklist the launch owner signs off against. Use when a launch, restock, or spend increase is about to go live and the cost of finding a gap after the fact is high. Boundary: `marketing-automation` designs ongoing marketing and sales automation that runs indefinitely; this skill is a single pre-launch checklist for one specific launch date, not an automation build."

# The Launch Gate

Take a launch that's about to go live and produce a go, go-with-conditions, or hold verdict, with every readiness layer named as verified or assumed.

> **Findings discipline.** Read `references/audit-findings-discipline.md` before writing the
> output. It covers what happens to a finding after it is written: the audit's date and exact
> scope, a re-audit trigger stated as an event, severity paired with effort so the list
> resolves into a sequence, and a baseline captured before anything changes so the fixes are
> attributable. Its readiness board already carries owner and due-before-launch. What it needs is the dated scope and the post-launch baseline: which metric each watch-list signal is measured against, captured before launch rather than reconstructed after.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
This skill is standalone by design: ask inline for what it needs rather than reading a context file.

**No context file, no problem. Build it, do not bounce the user.** If `.agents/product-context.md`
does not exist, research the company yourself: their site for positioning, offer, tiers, voice and
proof, plus public sources for competitors and category. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside the three-question budget. Write what you learn to `.agents/product-context.md` so
the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line what you inferred rather than observed.
Never tell the user to go and run a different skill before you can start.

**Write it the way you would say it, out loud, to a coworker.** Read `references/house-rules.md`
and apply it to everything you return. Two rules matter most, repeated here directly: **never use
an em dash or en dash, anywhere, not once** (use a period, a comma, or brackets instead), and
**write for a 7th grader** - plain words, one idea per sentence, short sentences that flow into each
other so the reader scans and understands on the first pass, never a sentence they have to re-read.
Answer first, ordinary words, top three rather than all fourteen. Its nine-question check, quality
plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.
## How to run


**The list below is longer than three, and three is the cap.** Most of it you can get without
asking: read the context file, fetch the URL they named, compute it, or look up the platform
default. Ask only for the three that genuinely cannot be derived and that most change the output.
State the rest as assumptions, marked as assumptions, and let the user correct the one that matters.

Ask the user for these inputs. If any are missing, ask before scoring anything.

1. **What's launching, when, and the expected traffic or spend peak.**
2. **Ecom or SaaS launch, and the matching layer-1 position:** stock/fulfillment position for the
   launch items if physical inventory is involved, or feature-flag/entitlement rollout plan plus seat
   activation for existing accounts if this is a SaaS feature or plan-tier launch.
3. **Page or creative status**: URLs or screenshots for the launch assets.
4. **Tracking setup**: which conversion events are wired up for this launch.
5. **Lifecycle flows scheduled around the launch**: launch email/SMS, and anything that might overlap or conflict with them.
6. **Margin position** at the planned price or discount, if pricing is changing for the launch.
7. **Who owns the go/no-go call and who can execute a rollback.**

## Method

**SaaS and ecom launches fail on different layer 1s.** State which launch type this is in the first
line of the output, and use the matching layer-1 definition below rather than forcing a stock
question onto a feature launch or a rollout question onto a physical one. Layers 2-7 apply unchanged
to both.

1. Walk 7 readiness layers in this fixed order and mark each Ready, At Risk, or Blocked: (1) stock/fulfillment capacity including an oversell scenario **(ecom)**, or feature-flag/entitlement rollout plus seat activation and docs/help-center readiness **(SaaS)**, (2) page/creative clarity and proof, (3) checkout or signup mechanic including any promo code tested end to end, (4) tracking (event fires, values correct, no duplicate counting), (5) lifecycle flows scheduled and not conflicting with each other, (6) support coverage for expected question themes (support macros and a live help-center article for a SaaS launch), (7) margin at the planned price surviving fees and expected returns.
2. For each layer, state whether it was actually verified (someone tested it) or only assumed. An assumed layer cannot be marked Ready; mark it At Risk with "unverified" as the stated reason.
3. Test any discount, promo code, or pricing mechanic end to end before go, checking specifically for stacking with other codes, minimum-threshold logic, excluded items, and expiry timing.
4. Model the oversell/overload scenario explicitly: what happens if demand runs at 3x the plan and stock, capacity, or infrastructure runs out mid-launch (ecom), or the entitlement/rollout system mis-flags a cohort and grants or blocks access to the wrong accounts at scale (SaaS). This cannot be skipped because it feels overly cautious; it is the most common launch failure.
5. Roll up all 7 layers into one verdict: Go, Go with conditions, or Hold. Any layer marked Blocked forces at minimum Go with conditions. More than one Blocked layer, or any Blocked layer with no path to close before the launch date, forces Hold.
6. Name every condition attached to a Go with conditions verdict, with an owner and a due-before-launch date. A condition with no owner is not a real condition.
7. Define the first-hour and first-day watch list: 3-5 signals to monitor immediately after go-live, the threshold that triggers concern, and the specific rollback action tied to each.

## Output format

**Go/no-go verdict:** Go, Go with conditions, or Hold, with conditions named and owned.

**Readiness board**

| Layer | Status | Verified or assumed | Blocker | Owner | Due before launch |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Oversell/overload scenario:** what happens if demand is 3x plan, and the response.

**Watch list and rollback**

| Signal | Threshold | Rollback action |
|---|---|---|

## Rules

- Never mark a layer Ready on assumption; unverified means At Risk at best.
- Never issue a Go verdict while any layer is Blocked with no path to close before launch, regardless of time pressure.
- Never fix anything directly as part of this check; the output is a list for the launch owner to act on, not a set of unannounced changes.
- Never skip the oversell/overload scenario.
- Never promise launch performance numbers (revenue, conversion) this check cannot know.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:

- Is the launch type (ecom or SaaS) stated up front, with layer 1 matching it (stock/fulfillment for
  ecom; feature-flag/entitlement rollout + seat activation + docs for SaaS) rather than a generic
  stock question forced onto a feature launch?
- Does every layer show Verified or Assumed explicitly, with Assumed capped at At Risk?
- Is the discount or promo mechanic tested end to end for stacking, thresholds, exclusions, and expiry, not just confirmed to exist?
- Is the oversell/overload scenario addressed, not omitted?
- Does the verdict match the stated rule (any Blocked layer with no path to close before launch forces Hold)?
- Does every condition and watch-list rollback action have a named owner or threshold, not left implicit?

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.


## Visual readiness board (only when the tool is actually available)

**Check your own toolset before offering this, don't assume it.** Look at what tools you actually
have access to in this run. If one of them publishes a rendered visual page (for example, an
`Artifact` tool in Claude Code or claude.ai), render the readiness board as an actual traffic-light
status board (each layer colored Ready/At Risk/Blocked, verified-vs-assumed marked distinctly), with
the watch list shown as a second panel, since a go/no-go checklist is exactly the kind of document
shared in a launch review meeting and a status board reads faster than a text table in that setting.
Use the exact statuses already assessed above; do not re-assess anything for the board. If your host's
artifact tool requires a design step first (Claude Code's does), do that step before publishing.

This is additive only. Hand back the link alongside the full text tables, never instead of them. If
no such tool is available in this run, skip this step without comment and return the text tables
only. A missing artifact tool is not a failure and not worth flagging.
