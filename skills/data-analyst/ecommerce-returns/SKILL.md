Use when a return rate is rising, a specific SKU returns far above the catalog average, or returns are logged as a cost line instead of mined for the fix behind them. Boundary: this skill works from structured, coded return reasons tied to SKUs. If the input is free-text reviews or support tickets with no reason-code field, say so: the coded-reason analysis here does not apply and the raw text needs reading rather than tallying."

# The Returns Miner

Take a returns export with SKU-level reason codes and find which products have a real return concentration problem and which coded reason is driving it, using a stated concentration threshold, not a read of whichever returns feel memorable.

> **Input integrity.** Run the checks in `references/data-input-integrity.md` before computing
> anything, and report what they found. Each one produces a confident wrong answer rather than
> a visible error, so a broken input does not announce itself. Return rates on low-volume SKUs are the classic false finding here: one return out of three orders is 33% and means nothing. Date every return to the original sale, not the return date.
> Where a check cannot run because the export lacks the field, say so and state what it limits
> the conclusion to.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
This skill is standalone by design: ask inline for what it needs rather than reading a context file.

**No context file, no problem. Build it, do not bounce the user.** If `.agents/product-context.md`
does not exist, research the company yourself: their site for positioning, offer, tiers, voice and
proof, plus public sources for competitors and category. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside the three-question budget. Write what you learn to `.agents/product-context.md` so
the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line what you inferred rather than observed.
Never tell the user to go and run a different skill before you can start.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Validate reason codes against the product before trusting the concentration.** A code that cannot
> apply to a SKU, "wrong size" on a non-apparel item, "damaged in transit" on a digital good, is
> evidence of miscoding, and miscoding invalidates the root-cause conclusion even when the totals look
> clean. Check that each SKU's top reasons are physically possible for that product, and where they are
> not, report the coding problem as the finding rather than the reason as a cause. A catalogue where
> staff pick the first dropdown option produces a confident wrong answer every time.


> **When an input is missing, choose a response - never fill the hole silently.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/missing-input-protocol.md`. Read it and follow it.

## How to run

Ask the user for these inputs. If any are missing, ask before analyzing.

1. **Returns export**: one row per return, with SKU, date, quantity, and a reason code or reason label.
2. **Sales volume per SKU for the same period**: without this, a return count can be ranked but not judged as high or normal for that product.
3. **Whether reasons are customer-selected, agent-selected, or free text**: a coded field from a fixed dropdown is far more reliable than an agent's guess at the customer's real reason, and free text is out of scope here: a coded-reason tally cannot be run on it, so say so and treat the raw text as something to read rather than count.

4. **Category or product type per SKU.** A Shopify product-type or collection export is fine. Without
it every SKU is compared against your whole catalog, which flags footwear and apparel as broken when
they are simply high-return categories behaving normally.

## Method

1. **Normalize every raw reason code or label into one of eight fixed themes** before grouping anything: sizing/fit, product expectation mismatch, quality issue, shipping damage, wrong item shipped, late delivery, buyer remorse, unclear compatibility. State the mapping used from raw code to theme, since raw codes vary by returns system and get misread if assumed.
2. **Group normalized returns by SKU, then by theme within each SKU.** Tally return count and quantity per SKU-theme pair.
3. **Compute each SKU's return rate as returned units (not return rows) divided by units sold**, for
   that SKU. A return row covering more than one unit must contribute its full unit count, not one
   count per row, or the rate overstates itself on any multi-unit return.

   **Date each returned unit to the sale it came from, not to the period the return arrived in.** A
   return landing this month is for a sale made three to six weeks earlier once shipping and the
   return window are allowed for, so a same-period numerator and denominator describe different
   cohorts of sales. Whenever unit volume is changing, they do not line up, and the error is large:

   - Growing 30% a month, a SKU whose true return rate is 20% measures **16.8%**, understated by 3.2
     points, every month, for as long as growth continues. A real problem clears the 1.5x
     concentration test it should fail.
   - Declining 30% a month, that same 20% reality measures **26.0%**, overstated by 6 points, so a
     fading SKU gets flagged for a returns problem it does not have.
   - The bias **flips sign with the growth rate**, so it cannot be corrected with a constant
     adjustment. Only aligning the numerator to the sale period fixes it.

   If the export carries the original order date or order ID, use it and say so. If it does not, either
   use a window long enough that the lag is small relative to it (a quarter or more, not a month), or
   report the rate with the SKU's unit-volume trend stated next to it and say the rate is understated
   while volume is growing and overstated while it is shrinking. Do not present a same-period rate for
   a fast-moving SKU as if it were the SKU's actual return rate.
4. **Use the SKU's category average as the baseline, computed with the SKU under test excluded
   (leave-one-out). Fall back to the catalog average, also leave-one-out, only when the SKU's category
   has fewer than 5 other SKUs with return data**, and state which baseline was used for every SKU,
   since a SKU can sit above one average and below the other.

   Excluding the SKU from its own baseline is not a refinement. A high-return SKU inside the average it
   is measured against inflates that average and dampens its own multiple, and in a small category the
   effect is enough to change the verdict. Worked case: peers at 10%, the SKU at 16%. Its true multiple
   is 1.60x, a concentration. Included in a 5-SKU category average of 11.2%, it measures **1.43x and is
   not flagged at all.** The distortion shrinks as the category grows (the flip band is roughly 1.50x
   to 1.71x at 5 SKUs, narrowing to 1.50x to 1.53x at 30), so it bites hardest in exactly the small
   categories this step already treats as fragile. Even where the verdict holds, self-inclusion
   understates severity: a SKU at a true 5.00x reports 2.78x in a 5-SKU category. Flag return concentration using a stated multiple of whichever baseline was used, not a gut call: at least 1.5x is a concentration, at least 2x is severe. State the SKU's exact rate and the exact average and baseline type it's being compared to for every flagged SKU.
4a. **Report the peer count behind every baseline.** A category average computed from 3 peers is a
   different kind of number from one computed from 30, and the multiple should not be presented with
   the same confidence. Where the leave-one-out peer count is below 5 even after the catalog fallback,
   say the baseline is too thin to support a concentration verdict rather than issuing one.

5. **Assign the likely root cause per flagged SKU as its single highest-volume theme.** If two themes are within 10% of each other's count for that SKU, name both rather than forcing a single cause.
6. **Separate preventable themes from normal category behavior, and map each to a fix category.** Sizing/fit and unclear compatibility (PDP copy, sizing guide) and expectation mismatch (PDP copy, imagery) are preventable through content; quality issue (product/QC review) and shipping damage (packaging/fulfillment) through operations; wrong item is a fulfillment process fix, not a PDP fix. Buyer remorse, and late delivery unless a fulfillment failure is confirmed, are normal category behavior, not a defect to fix on the product page.

## Output format

**Returns verdict:** [X] SKUs show return concentration (rate ≥ 1.5x their baseline), of which [Y] are severe (≥ 2x). State the catalog-wide average return rate for context, separate from the per-SKU baselines used to flag concentration.

**Concentration table**

| SKU | Return rate (units) | Baseline used (category or catalog) | Baseline rate | Multiple | Likely root cause (theme) | Fix category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Preventable vs. normal split**: return volume attributed to preventable themes versus buyer remorse and confirmed-normal late delivery, stated as counts, not just percentages.

**Fix queue**: preventable findings grouped by fix category (PDP copy, sizing guide, imagery, product/QC, packaging/fulfillment), ranked by return volume within each SKU's revenue.

**Missing data**: whether reasons were customer-selected, agent-selected, or blank, and what that implies about how much to trust the coded reason as the true cause.

## Rules

- Never flag a SKU as a concentration without stating its exact return rate (in returned units, not return rows), which baseline (category or catalog) it's compared to, and that baseline's value.
- Never mix baselines for the same SKU across the verdict, table, and narrative; use the one baseline the method assigned it.
- Never treat a coded reason as certain when it was agent-selected rather than customer-selected; note the difference in confidence.
- Never call buyer remorse or normal late delivery a preventable defect requiring a product or PDP fix.
- Never recommend a stricter return policy as the default response to a concentration finding; find the theme behind it first.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:
- Were reason codes checked as physically possible for each SKU, with implausible codes reported as a
  coding problem rather than accepted as a root cause?

- Is every returned unit dated to the sale it came from rather than to the period the return arrived
  in? If the export cannot support that, is the SKU's unit-volume trend stated alongside the rate, with
  the direction of the bias named (understated while growing, overstated while shrinking)?
- Is every baseline computed leave-one-out, with the SKU under test excluded from the average it is
  measured against?
- Is the peer count behind each baseline reported, and is a concentration verdict withheld where fewer
  than 5 peers remain after the catalog fallback?
- Is the exact rate, the exact baseline, the baseline type, and the peer count shown for every flagged
  SKU, so the multiple can be recomputed by hand?
- Does every flagged SKU show its exact return rate (units, not rows), which baseline it used, that baseline's value, and the multiple, not just a verdict of "high"?
- Is the same baseline (category, or catalog only for thin categories) used consistently for one SKU across the verdict, table, and narrative, rather than switching between them?
- Is the 1.5x / 2x threshold used stated explicitly, and is it applied consistently across every SKU?
- Is the root cause assigned from the highest-volume theme for that specific SKU, with ties named rather than forced to one theme?
- Is buyer remorse excluded from the preventable fix queue?
- Does the output state whether reasons were customer-selected or agent-selected, and reflect that in confidence?

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.

## Chain with

End by naming what runs next, in one line:

- `product-page-optimization` fix the product pages behind the top return reasons

Say it as **Next:** followed by that skill.

## Quick mode

A messy export is normal. Take it.

If reason codes are free text rather than a clean taxonomy, group them yourself into fit, quality,
not-as-described, damaged, changed-mind and other, then say you did and show the grouping so the user
can correct it. If returns are not tied to SKUs, work at category level and say so. Refusing a messy
CSV means refusing most real stores.

State the mode you ran in, in the first two lines, so nobody mistakes a rough read for a full one.
The rest of the method in `references/house-rules.md` rule 8 applies.
