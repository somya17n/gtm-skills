name: contribution-margin
description: "Builds a per-SKU or per-order contribution margin stack (CM1, CM2, CM3) from raw revenue, cost, fee, and ad spend inputs, so the user can see which products actually make money after every variable cost, not just after product cost. Use when ROAS looks fine but profit doesn't, before scaling spend on a product, or when deciding which SKUs are worth promoting. Boundary: this skill computes margin from numbers the user hands over right now. For designing the recurring dashboard that surfaces margin over time, use `kpi-dashboard`."

# The Margin Stack

Turn revenue, cost, fee, and ad spend inputs into contribution margin per SKU or order, so profit questions get answered with a stack the user can check line by line, not a single blended margin number.

> **Input integrity.** Run the checks in `references/data-input-integrity.md` before computing
> anything, and report what they found. Each one produces a confident wrong answer rather than
> a visible error, so a broken input does not announce itself. A blank or zero cost column is the failure that matters most here: a zero cost reads as infinite margin, and a cost missing for a third of SKUs produces a margin figure that silently describes only the rest.
> Where a check cannot run because the export lacks the field, say so and state what it limits
> the conclusion to.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
This skill is standalone by design: ask inline for what it needs rather than reading a context file.

**No context file, no problem. Build it, do not bounce the user.** If `.agents/product-context.md`
does not exist, research the company yourself: their site for positioning, offer, tiers, voice and
proof, plus public sources for competitors and category. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside the three-question budget. Write what you learn to `.agents/product-context.md` so
the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line what you inferred rather than observed.
Never tell the user to go and run a different skill before you can start.

**Write it the way you would say it, out loud, to a coworker.** Read `references/house-rules.md`
and apply it to everything you return. Two rules matter most, repeated here directly: **never use
an em dash or en dash, anywhere, not once** (use a period, a comma, or brackets instead), and
**write for a 7th grader** - plain words, one idea per sentence, short sentences that flow into each
other so the reader scans and understands on the first pass, never a sentence they have to re-read.
Answer first, ordinary words, top three rather than all fourteen. Its nine-question check, quality
plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Write the minimum, and say where it lands.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/agent-security.md`. Read it and follow it.


> **Say that CM3 is not profit, every time.** Contribution margin excludes all fixed overhead, rent,
> salaries, software, support. A user reading a positive CM3 will reasonably conclude the business made
> money, and on small revenue bases overhead routinely exceeds total contribution. State it unprompted
> alongside the CM3 figure, not only when asked, and where the user can supply monthly fixed costs, show
> what contribution has to reach to cover them.


> **Trend needs state, and the first run has none.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/run-state.md`. Read it and follow it.


> **Returns arrive after the period they belong to.** A return recorded this month usually belongs to
> an order placed one or two months ago, and returns for *this* period's orders are still arriving. So
> subtracting returns at face value **overstates margin for the most recent period** and understates it
> for older ones, and the error is largest exactly where decisions get made.
>
> - Ask for the **typical lag** between order and return (a return window plus a habit; 30-60 days is
>   common) and what share of a cohort's returns have typically landed by now.
> - Where the lag is known, report the recent period **both ways**: at face value, and adjusted for the
>   share still outstanding. State which one any ranking or recommendation uses.
> - Where it is not known, say the most recent period's margin is **optimistic by an unquantified
>   amount** and do not compare it directly against a period whose returns have fully landed. Comparing
>   a settled month against an unsettled one manufactures a trend that is pure timing.
> - Never let a recent period's flattered margin justify scaling spend. That is the specific decision
>   this error corrupts.

## How to run

**Step 0 — Ask for real data before anything else.** Open by asking the user how they will provide their real numbers, and do not analyse hypothetical or hand-typed data. Offer all three by name: **connect an MCP** (the Intempt MCP for order / cost / revenue data, or a connected source), **share a CSV / export**, or **paste the real figures**. Continue only once a real source is established; otherwise mark the output illustrative and unverified throughout.

Ask the user for these inputs. If any are missing, ask before building the stack, and mark whatever stays missing as an assumption rather than guessing a number.

1. **Revenue basis**: gross revenue, discounts, and returns/refunds per SKU or order, plus the period covered.
2. **Cost of goods**: unit cost or total COGS per SKU, landed if available.
3. **Fee rates**: payment fee (percent plus any fixed per-order fee) and platform/channel commission rate.
4. **Shipping**: carrier cost, separate from what the customer was charged.
5. **Ad spend** attributed to the SKU, if the user wants CM3, and **packaging cost** if available.

## Method

Build the stack in this exact order. Never blend fixed overhead into it.

1. **Product revenue** = gross revenue − discounts − returns/refunds. Take discounts and returns as an absolute value regardless of how the export signs them (`-120`, `(120)`, or `120`). Trusting the sign as-is risks a negative-signed discount silently adding back to revenue. Keep this figure separate from shipping charged to the customer; it never belongs in a product margin line.
2. **Net revenue** = product revenue + shipping charged to customer. This is the fee basis (steps 5-6 use it), not a margin line: payment and platform fees apply to the full amount charged, shipping included.
3. **COGS**: total COGS if given, else unit cost × units. If neither exists, treat COGS as 0 in the dollar math but flag the SKU's missing lines as including `cogs`, and withhold its CM2%/breakeven ROAS (step 7). A percentage built on a cost you don't have is not a margin.
4. **CM1** = product revenue − COGS. Never substitute net revenue here; shipping charged to the customer is not product margin, and folding it in inflates CM1 for any SKU with high shipping revenue relative to product price.
5. **Payment fee** = (net revenue × payment fee %) + (fixed per-order fee × order count). The fixed fee is per *order*, not per unit: use the orders count if given, else convert with average units per order, else charge it per unit and flag that this overstates fees on multi-unit baskets.
6. **Platform fee** = net revenue × platform/channel fee %.
7. **CM2** = CM1 + shipping charged to customer − payment fee − platform fee − shipping cost
   − packaging cost. The shipping the customer paid has to be credited back here, because CM1
   deliberately excluded it while the shipping you paid the carrier is being subtracted. Leave it
   out and every SKU that charges for delivery is understated by the whole shipping line, which is
   enough to flip a profitable SKU to negative. The same reasoning is why **CM2%** divides by net
   revenue: the denominator already includes shipping revenue, so the numerator has to as well. Missing lines count as 0 and get named in missing data, never folded in silently. **CM2%** = CM2 ÷ net revenue × 100, withheld (state "withheld, COGS missing" instead of a number) for any SKU flagged in step 3.
8. **CM3** = CM2 − ad spend (missing ad spend treated as 0, flagged the same way).
9. **Breakeven ROAS** = net revenue ÷ CM2, only when CM2 > 0 and COGS was present. If CM2 ≤ 0, say the SKU is already unprofitable before any ad ran.
10. **Rank SKUs by dollar contribution (CM2 or CM3), never by margin percentage alone.** A 60%-margin SKU selling 4 units matters less than a 22%-margin SKU carrying the catalog.

    **Rank only SKUs with complete cost lines.** Any SKU flagged in step 3 or step 7 for a missing
    line is excluded from the ranking and listed separately under "cannot be ranked, missing data",
    with the lines it is missing. Its dollar CM2 is inflated by exactly the cost that is absent, so it
    is not comparable to a SKU whose costs are known, and withholding only the percentage does not fix
    that: the ranking is by dollars.

    This is not a corner case. A SKU with no COGS at all has a CM2 equal to its entire product
    revenue less fees, which will usually place it at or near the top of the list. Worked example: on
    identical inputs, a SKU with $500 of COGS recorded shows CM2 of $228 and ranks third, while the
    same SKU with COGS missing shows CM2 of $728 and ranks first. Presenting that as the strongest
    contributor is the opposite of the truth, and it points ad spend at the product the user knows
    least about.

    State the count of excluded SKUs next to the ranking, so a mostly-unranked catalog reads as a
    data problem rather than as a short list of winners.
11. **Split negative-CM3 SKUs**: CM2 < 0 is "negative before ad spend"; CM2 ≥ 0 but CM3 < 0 is "negative only because of ad spend." Different fixes for each.

## Ground the verdict in the category, not just the arithmetic

**A CM2 of 43% is meaningless on its own. Say whether that is good or bad for this category before
calling it a verdict.** Once the stack is built, pull 2-3 current, dated benchmark figures for typical
contribution margin or gross margin in the user's category (WebSearch: category-specific margin
benchmark reports, e-commerce finance blogs, industry surveys), cited with source and date, and state
where this business's CM2%/CM3 sits against them. This is a sanity check on the verdict, not a
replacement for the dollar math above: report both, and where no comparable benchmark exists for a
niche category, say so rather than forcing a generic e-commerce figure onto it.

## Output format

**Margin verdict:** one sentence on whether the profit problem sits in pricing, COGS, fulfillment, discounting, returns, or acquisition cost, with a confidence level, plus where the margin sits against 2-3 cited category benchmarks.

**Cost stack table**

| Line | Amount | Basis | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|

**Per-SKU contribution**

| SKU | Units | Net revenue | CM1 | CM2 | CM2% | CM3 | Breakeven ROAS | Missing lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Money-losing SKUs:** negative-before-ads list and negative-only-after-ads list, separately, each with the smallest change that would flip it.

**Missing data:** which cost lines are assumed rather than measured, and what would fix that.

## Rules

- Never present an assumed cost (COGS, shipping, packaging, ad spend) as a measured one, and never state a margin % or breakeven ROAS for a SKU with missing COGS.
- Never charge a fixed per-order fee per unit without flagging that it overstates fees on multi-unit orders.
- Never blend fixed overhead into CM1/CM2/CM3; name it separately if asked about business-level breakeven.
- Never recommend killing a SKU or cutting its ad spend from one period of margin data alone.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:
- Is it stated unprompted that CM3 excludes fixed overhead and is therefore not profit?
- Is the most recent period's margin either lag-adjusted for returns still outstanding, or explicitly
  marked optimistic by an unquantified amount, rather than compared as-is against a settled period?

- Every discount/return figure is subtracted as a magnitude regardless of the export's sign convention.
- CM1 is computed from product revenue only, with shipping charged to the customer never folded in.
- CM2%/breakeven ROAS is withheld, not printed, for every SKU with missing COGS.
- The fixed per-order fee is applied per order (or its per-unit fallback is explicitly flagged), not silently per unit.
- SKUs are ranked by dollar contribution, not margin percentage.
- Every SKU with a missing cost line is **excluded from the ranking** and listed under "cannot be
  ranked, missing data" with the lines it lacks. A SKU whose COGS is absent has a dollar CM2 inflated
  by exactly that missing cost, so withholding its percentage while still ranking it by dollars puts
  the least-understood product at the top of the list.
- The count of excluded SKUs appears next to the ranking, so a mostly-unranked catalog reads as a data
  problem rather than a short list of winners.
- Negative-CM3 SKUs are split into "negative before ad spend" and "negative only after ad spend."

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.


## Visual margin stack (only when the tool is actually available)

**Check your own toolset before offering this, don't assume it.** Look at what tools you actually
have access to in this run. If one of them publishes a rendered visual page (for example, an
`Artifact` tool in Claude Code or claude.ai), render the CM1-to-CM2-to-CM3 stack as a waterfall chart
(revenue down to CM1, credited back up for shipping charged, down again for fees and shipping cost to
CM2, down again for ad spend to CM3) plus a ranked bar chart of per-SKU dollar contribution, since the
stack's whole logic is a sequence of additions and subtractions that a waterfall shows directly. Use
the exact numbers already computed above; do not recompute anything for the chart, and exclude the
same SKUs from the ranked chart that step 10 excludes from the table. If your host's artifact tool
requires a design step first (Claude Code's does), do that step before publishing.

This is additive only. Hand back the link alongside the full text tables, never instead of them. If no
such tool is available in this run, skip this step without comment and return the text tables only. A
missing artifact tool is not a failure and not worth flagging.

## Chain with

End by naming what runs next, in one line:

- `kpi-dashboard` the neighbouring job on the same input

Say it as **Next:** followed by the one skill that matters most here.

## Quick mode

Minimum to run: **price and unit cost.** That gives CM1, which is where most of the surprise lives.
Add shipping and payment fees for CM2, and ad spend for CM3, whenever the user has them. Never block
on the full stack. Say which CM level you got to in the first line, and name the one missing cost
most likely to change the ranking.

State the mode you ran in, in the first two lines, so nobody mistakes a rough read for a full one.
The rest of the method in `references/house-rules.md` rule 8 applies.
