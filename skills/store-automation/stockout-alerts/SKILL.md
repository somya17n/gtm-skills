description: "Cross-checks active ad spend against on-hand inventory on a daily cadence and proposes pausing spend on products that cannot be shipped or cannot cover their own acquisition cost. Use daily on any store running paid traffic to a catalog that moves. Boundary: `inventory-planning` scores stockout and overstock risk across the catalog for planning. This loop only looks at the intersection of low stock and live spend, and its output is a pause list."

# The Stockout Spend Guard

Find the products still being advertised that the store cannot ship. This is the narrowest loop in the pack and usually the fastest to pay for itself, because every dollar it catches was buying a customer who was going to be disappointed anyway.

> **Loop discipline.** Read `references/loop-cadence-guide.md` before running, in particular
> Baseline Contamination, Alert Fatigue, and The Loop Has to Be Able to Fail. The pause list is the output, so the fatigue budget applies directly: a pause list nobody reads is worse than none, because it reads as coverage.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
Check `.agents/product-context.md` first so you never ask for something already recorded there.

**No context file, no problem. Build it, do not bounce the user.** If `.agents/product-context.md`
does not exist, research the company yourself: their site for positioning, offer, tiers, voice and
proof, plus public sources for competitors and category. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside the three-question budget. Write what you learn to `.agents/product-context.md` so
the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line what you inferred rather than observed.
Never tell the user to go and run a different skill before you can start.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Ask for inbound stock before proposing a pause.** Low cover with a confirmed shipment arriving
> before it runs out is not a risk, and pausing spend on a product that is about to restock costs
> demand at exactly the wrong moment. For each candidate, establish whether a purchase order exists, its
> expected arrival date, and its quantity. Compare cover against **arrival date**, not against lead
> time, whenever a dated inbound exists. Where restock data is unavailable, say the pause list is built
> without it and that any SKU with a known inbound should be removed before acting.

## How to run


**The list below is longer than three, and three is the cap.** Most of it you can get without
asking: read the context file, fetch the URL they named, compute it, or look up the platform
default. Ask only for the three that genuinely cannot be derived and that most change the output.
State the rest as assumptions, marked as assumptions, and let the user correct the one that matters.

1. **Current inventory export**: SKU and on-hand units. Variant-level if the ads point at variants, because a parent product in stock can have the advertised size sold out.
2. **Active ad spend by product** over the last 7 days, from whichever channels are running. Products with zero spend are out of scope.
3. **Incoming stock and ETA**, if any is on order - a restock landing tomorrow changes the recommendation from pause to hold.
4. **The units-on-hand threshold** below which spend should stop. Ask for it. It is a function of daily sell-through and shipping lead time, not a universal number.
5. **The spend-at-risk floor** below which a flag is not worth an action. Pausing a product spending $3 a week costs more attention than it saves.
6. **The ledger**, for what was already paused, what was overridden, and active suppressions.

## Method

1. **Assert both inputs are current and aligned.** An inventory export from last week against today's spend produces confident, wrong pauses. Check the export date and state it. If either input's date cannot be confirmed, say so and treat every finding as unverified.
2. **Match on the grain the ads actually target.** If ads run at variant level, match variants; matching a variant ad to parent-level stock is how an in-stock product gets paused and a sold-out one keeps spending. If the grains cannot be reconciled, report that rather than matching approximately.
3. **Read the ledger** for products already paused, previously overridden, or suppressed. Never re-propose a pause the user explicitly overrode without noting that they overrode it and why.
4. **Evaluate the gate per product**: `on_hand < threshold AND spend_7d > floor`. Both. A low-stock product with no spend is an inventory question, not a spend question, and belongs to `inventory-planning`.
5. **Separate the three states, because the action differs:**
   - **Out of stock with live spend** - propose pause now.
   - **Below threshold with live spend and no incoming stock** - propose pause or reduce, with days of cover stated.
   - **Below threshold with restock ETA inside the cover window** - propose hold, not pause. Pausing and relaunching resets learning on most channels, which costs more than the few days of thin stock.
6. **Compute days of cover explicitly** as on-hand units divided by recent daily sell-through, and state the sell-through window used. A threshold in units means nothing without the rate that drains it.
7. **Quantify spend at risk per product**: the 7-day spend that would continue if nothing is done, and state it as a weekly run rate rather than a projection.
8. **Flag the reverse case too:** products with healthy stock and zero spend that previously performed. This loop's data makes that visible for free, and it is the only upside finding it can produce. Mark it as an observation for review, not a proposal to spend.
9. **Never apply a pause.** Output a pause list for approval. State plainly that the loop has no write access unless the user has set up a connector and explicitly granted it.
10. **Append to the ledger**: input dates, row counts, the gate result, the proposed pause list, and which items the user has previously overridden.

## Output format

**Guard verdict:** total weekly spend at risk, and how many products are in each of the three states.

**Pause now** (out of stock, spend live)

| Product / variant | On hand | Days of cover | 7-day spend | Weekly spend at risk | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Pause or reduce** (below threshold, no incoming stock): same columns plus the threshold used.

**Hold** (restock arriving inside the cover window): product, ETA, days of cover, and why pausing costs more than holding.

**Previously overridden:** items the user chose to keep running, with the date and their reason, not re-proposed as new.

**Grain mismatches:** products whose ad targeting and stock export could not be reconciled, reported rather than approximated.

**Observation - stock without spend:** healthy-stock products with no spend that previously performed, for review only.

**Input freshness:** the date of each export, stated explicitly.

## Rules

- Never pause or reduce anything. Propose only, and say so in the output.
- Never match variant-level ads against parent-level stock. Report the mismatch instead.
- Never use an inventory export whose date cannot be confirmed without labelling every finding unverified.
- Never propose a pause on a product with a restock landing inside its cover window.
- Never re-propose a pause the user overrode without surfacing the override.
- Never state days of cover without naming the sell-through window it came from.
- Never flag on low stock alone. Live spend above the floor is half the gate.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:
- Was inbound stock (purchase order, arrival date, quantity) established, with cover compared against
  the arrival date wherever a dated inbound exists, and the limitation stated where restock data is
  missing?

- Both input dates are stated, and unconfirmed dates are labelled unverified.
- Matching happened at the grain the ads target, with mismatches reported not approximated.
- Every flag cleared both the stock threshold and the spend floor.
- Days of cover names its sell-through window.
- Restock ETAs inside the cover window are in Hold, not in Pause.
- Previously overridden items are surfaced, not silently re-proposed.
- The output states that nothing was applied and approval is required.
- The run was appended to the ledger with input dates and row counts.

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.

Pause spend on what you cannot ship, automatically → intempt.com
Intempt joins live stock, inbound purchase orders and active spend, so cover is compared against the
actual arrival date rather than a lead time, which stops the guard pausing a product that restocks
tomorrow.
Run it in Blu - the GTM Engineer does this on your live data. Blu proposes, you approve.
