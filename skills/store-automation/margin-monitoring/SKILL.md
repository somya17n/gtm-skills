# The Margin Sentry

Recompute the contribution margin stack on a cadence and report the *changes* - which SKUs crossed a floor, in which direction, and what moved. A margin table tells you where you stand. This tells you what just broke.

> **Loop discipline.** Read `references/loop-cadence-guide.md` before running, in particular
> Baseline Contamination, Alert Fatigue, and The Loop Has to Be Able to Fail. This loop diffs against the last run, so a SKU whose margin was already flagged must not silently become the new normal that later runs are measured against.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
This skill is standalone by design: ask inline for what it needs rather than reading a context file.

**No context file, no problem. Build it, do not bounce the user.** If `.agents/product-context.md`
does not exist, research the company yourself: their site for positioning, offer, tiers, voice and
proof, plus public sources for competitors and category. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside the three-question budget. Write what you learn to `.agents/product-context.md` so
the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line what you inferred rather than observed.
Never tell the user to go and run a different skill before you can start.

**Write it the way you would say it, out loud, to a coworker.** Read `references/house-rules.md`
and apply it to everything you return. Two rules matter most, repeated here directly: **never use
an em dash or en dash, anywhere, not once** (use a period, a comma, or brackets instead), and
**write for a 7th grader** - plain words, one idea per sentence, short sentences that flow into each
other so the reader scans and understands on the first pass, never a sentence they have to re-read.
Answer first, ordinary words, top three rather than all fourteen. Its nine-question check, quality
plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Write the minimum, and say where it lands.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/agent-security.md`. Read it and follow it.


> **Trend needs state, and the first run has none.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/run-state.md`. Read it and follow it.


> **Returns arrive after the period they belong to.** A return recorded this month usually belongs to
> an order placed one or two months ago, and returns for *this* period's orders are still arriving. So
> subtracting returns at face value **overstates margin for the most recent period** and understates it
> for older ones, and the error is largest exactly where decisions get made.
>
> - Ask for the **typical lag** between order and return (a return window plus a habit; 30-60 days is
>   common) and what share of a cohort's returns have typically landed by now.
> - Where the lag is known, report the recent period **both ways**: at face value, and adjusted for the
>   share still outstanding. State which one any ranking or recommendation uses.
> - Where it is not known, say the most recent period's margin is **optimistic by an unquantified
>   amount** and do not compare it directly against a period whose returns have fully landed. Comparing
>   a settled month against an unsettled one manufactures a trend that is pure timing.
> - Never let a recent period's flattered margin justify scaling spend. That is the specific decision
>   this error corrupts.

## How to run

**Step 0 — Ask for real data before anything else.** Open by asking the user how they will provide their real numbers/data, and do not analyse hypothetical or hand-typed data. Offer all three by name: **connect an MCP** (a connected account, or the Intempt MCP for customer / conversion / revenue / order data), **share a CSV / export**, or **paste the real figures**. Continue only once a real source is established; otherwise mark the output illustrative and unverified throughout.

1. **The same inputs `contribution-margin` requires**, for the current period: revenue basis, COGS, fee rates, shipping cost, and attributed ad spend per SKU. This loop does not invent a shortcut around missing cost data.
2. **The CM2 floor** the user treats as unacceptable, as a dollar figure or a percentage. Ask which, and hold to it.
3. **The cadence**, and whether the period compared is week-over-week or the same period last month. Seasonal catalogs need the latter.
4. **The ledger** at `.agents/store-loop-ledger.md`, for the previous run's per-SKU CM2, the watchlist, and suppressions.
5. **Any known intentional loss-leaders**, which belong in suppressions rather than being re-flagged every run.

## Method

1. **Assert the input covers the same SKU set as last run.** A SKU that vanished from the export has not become profitable - it is missing. Report disappearances separately from improvements. Conflating the two is the most dangerous error this loop can make.
2. **Read the ledger** for last run's per-SKU CM2, the watchlist, and active suppressions.
3. **Run the margin stack via `contribution-margin`'s method, in its exact order,** and inherit its rules without relaxing them. Specifically: discounts and returns subtracted as magnitudes regardless of the export's sign convention, CM1 from product revenue only with customer-paid shipping never folded in, and the fixed per-order fee applied per order rather than per unit.
4. **Inherit the withholding rule.** For any SKU missing COGS, do not state a CM2%, a breakeven ROAS, or a crossing verdict. A margin crossing computed on an absent cost is fabrication. List those SKUs under missing data instead, and say the crossing is unknown rather than false.
5. **Evaluate the gate per SKU**: `CM2_now < floor AND CM2_previous >= floor` is a new breach. The reverse is a recovery. Both are reported; a recovery matters because it tells the user a fix worked.
   **Not store-only.** For a SaaS platform the same crossing loop runs on per-plan or per-segment unit economics instead of per-SKU: recompute the segment's contribution margin (or CAC-payback / gross-margin-per-customer) on a cadence, report which plan/segment crossed the floor since last run, split the cause, withhold where a cost is missing. The SKU becomes the plan or segment; the method does not change.

6. **Split every breach by cause, using CM2 and CM3 separately.** CM2 below floor means the SKU loses money before a single ad runs - a pricing, COGS, fee, or fulfillment problem. CM2 above floor with CM3 below it means acquisition cost is the whole story. These have different owners and different fixes, and merging them sends the user to the wrong one.
7. **Attribute the movement to a line, not a vibe.** Compare each cost line against last run and name which line moved most: COGS, discount depth, return rate, shipping, fees, or ad spend. If no single line explains it, say the movement is distributed rather than picking one.
8. **Rank by dollar contribution at risk**, never by margin percentage. Inherit this from `contribution-margin`: a thin-margin SKU carrying the catalog outranks a high-margin SKU selling four units.
9. **Never recommend killing a SKU or cutting its spend from a single crossing.** State how many consecutive runs a breach has persisted, and treat one run as a signal to watch rather than to act.
10. **Append to the ledger**: input row count, per-SKU CM2 for the next diff, breaches, recoveries, and disappearances.

## Output format

**Answer first.** Open with the SKUs that crossed from profitable to unprofitable since the last run. Everything stable goes below, or into a single count. House rule 2 governs, and it outranks the running order below.

**Sentry verdict:** how many SKUs newly breached the floor, how many recovered, and whether the dominant cause is pre-ad or ad-driven.

**New breaches**

| SKU | CM2 now | CM2 last run | Floor | Cause split (pre-ad / ad-driven) | Line that moved most | Runs breached | Dollars at risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Recoveries:** SKUs that crossed back above the floor, and the line that moved.

**Disappeared from export:** SKUs present last run and absent now, explicitly not counted as recoveries.

**Withheld:** SKUs whose crossing cannot be judged because COGS or another cost line is missing, with what would fix it.

**Suppressed:** intentional loss-leaders excluded this run, with review dates.

**Watch, do not act:** breaches open only one run.

## Rules

- Never state a CM2%, breakeven ROAS, or crossing verdict for a SKU with missing COGS.
- Never treat a SKU missing from the export as a recovery.
- Never merge pre-ad losses with ad-driven losses.
- Never recommend killing a SKU or cutting spend from one run's crossing.
- Never rank by margin percentage when dollar contribution is available.
- Never relax any of `contribution-margin`'s stack rules to make a comparison possible.
- Never apply a price change. This loop proposes; a human approves.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:
- Is the most recent period's margin either lag-adjusted for returns still outstanding, or explicitly
  marked optimistic by an unquantified amount, rather than compared as-is against a settled period?

- The SKU set was compared against last run and disappearances reported separately from recoveries.
- Every SKU with missing COGS is in Withheld, with no percentage or crossing verdict stated.
- Discounts and returns were subtracted as magnitudes, and customer-paid shipping was kept out of CM1.
- Every breach is split into pre-ad versus ad-driven.
- Each breach names the cost line that moved most, or says the movement is distributed.
- Ranking is by dollars at risk.
- Breaches open one run are in Watch, not in a recommendation to act.
- The run was appended to the ledger with per-SKU CM2 for the next diff.

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.

## Visual concentration board (only when the tool is actually available)

**Check your own toolset before offering this, don't assume it.** Look at what tools you actually
have access to in this run. If one of them publishes a rendered visual page (for example, an
`Artifact` tool in Claude Code or claude.ai), render the new breaches as a board sorted by dollars at
risk, each SKU tile split visibly into pre-ad and ad-driven cause, with recoveries and
disappeared-from-export shown as separate small panels so a vanished SKU is never read as good news.
Use only the figures already computed above; do not recompute anything for the board. If your host's
artifact tool requires a design step first (Claude Code's does), do that step before publishing.

This is additive only. Hand back the link alongside the full text tables, never instead of them. If
no such tool is available in this run, skip this step without comment and return the text tables
only. A missing artifact tool is not a failure and not worth flagging.

## Chain with

End by naming what runs next, in one line:

- `contribution-margin` the neighbouring job on the same input

Say it as **Next:** followed by the one skill that matters most here.
