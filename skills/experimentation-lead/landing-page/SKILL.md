# The Page Shipper

Designs a conversion-focused landing page: the copy framework matched to traffic source and awareness stage, section order, form length, proof placement, and prototype-ready HTML with Tailwind.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
Check `.agents/product-context.md` first so you never ask for something already recorded there.

**No context file, no problem. Build it, do not bounce the user.** If `.agents/product-context.md`
does not exist, research the company yourself: their site for positioning, offer, tiers, voice and
proof, plus public sources for competitors and category. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside the three-question budget. Write what you learn to `.agents/product-context.md` so
the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line what you inferred rather than observed.
Never tell the user to go and run a different skill before you can start.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Escape everything you interpolate into emitted markup.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/agent-security.md`. Read it and follow it.


> **Any markup this skill emits has an accessibility floor.** Read the relevant rules in
> `references/chart-form-and-accessibility.md`. Concretely: never carry meaning by colour alone, keep
> text contrast at 4.5:1 or better, give every input a real `<label>` rather than a placeholder, keep a
> visible focus state, use semantic landmarks and one `<h1>`, and give every image an `alt` that says
> what it communicates. A prototype that ships with these missing gets fixed after launch or never, and
> "prototype" is not an exemption, it is the version that gets copied.


> **A proof point is a number or a named customer, and it is never invented.** Read the **Proof
> Points** section of `.agents/product-context.md`. Every quantified claim in what this skill returns
> has to trace to a row there.
>
> - **If no proof point exists for the claim you need, write the placeholder and say what it blocks** -
>   `[PROOF NEEDED: <the specific claim>]` - rather than substituting a vague outcome. "Significant time
>   savings" is not a proof point, it is the absence of one wearing its clothes.
> - **Never soften a missing number into an adjective.** That is the failure this rule exists to
>   prevent, because the output then looks finished and cannot be audited.
> - **Use the citability flag.** An internal-only figure must not appear in anything a prospect sees.
>   Check the column before using the row.
> - Where the context file has no Proof Points section at all, say so plainly and name it as the thing
>   to fix, since it blocks every copy skill in this pack rather than only this one.


> **Copy standard.** The rule and its edge cases are in `references/outbound-copy-standards.md`. Read it and follow it.

## Context

1. Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing, ask the user to run `/gtm:product-context` first. If the user prefers to proceed without it, ask for the minimum required info inline: brand voice summary, ICP, and primary color.
2. Read `references/landing-page-patterns.md` for section patterns, copy frameworks, and conversion best practices.

> **Benchmark and form discipline.** Read the **Conversion Benchmarks**, **Form Length** and **Social
> Proof Placement** sections of `references/landing-page-patterns.md` before designing.
>
> Three things bind this skill:
>
> - **Ask what traffic will hit this page before quoting or targeting any conversion rate.** Traffic
>   source moves the number more than industry does: email converts around 19.3% against organic
>   search at 2.7%, a 7x spread inside any single industry. A 3% rate on cold organic is unremarkable;
>   the same 3% on warm email traffic is a broken page.
> - **Attack the field list first.** Three-field forms convert near 10.1% against 3.6% at nine fields,
>   and removing a single field has been measured at up to a 50% lift. Do this before headline testing
>   or layout. For every field ask whether it is used before the first human conversation, and prefer
>   enrichment from a work email over asking for company, size or industry.
> - **Put proof where the hesitation is.** Social proof lifts form conversion around 26%, and the same
>   signals near the form beat signals elsewhere on the page by roughly 12%. A logo wall in the hero
>   with the form unsupported leaves the deciding moment bare.


> **Ground the page in the live market and current, sourced benchmarks - never a template in a vacuum.**
> - **Research what is working across the market right now, do not design from memory.** Beyond direct competitors, read current teardowns, CRO blogs, and community threads - Reddit (r/SaaS, r/marketing, r/Entrepreneur, r/ecommerce), Indie Hackers, and G2 / review discussions - for how companies of the user's type and stage are structuring high-converting pages this year: which hero patterns and proof formats are landing, what has stopped working, and what the user's kind of buyer expects to see. Pull from real, dated sources and name them; the aim is current market convention for this specific space, not a generic best-practice list.
> - **Fetch two or three competitor landing / signup pages** for the same offer, from the brand kit's competitor set (run `brand-kit` if the space is not defined). Note their section order, promise, form length, and proof placement, and design to beat what the buyer sees elsewhere rather than to a generic template.
> - **Use current, dated benchmarks, each sourced.** Median landing-page conversion is ~6.6% (good ~10%, top 15-20% on warm email or tight targeting); by source email ~19.3%, paid social ~12%, PPC search ~10.9%, display ~4-5% - quote a target only against the traffic that will hit this page. Form-length reduction is the single highest-leverage lever (~120% lift in aggregate); conversion falls ~23% at 3 fields to ~17% at 5, ~11% at 7, ~7% at 10+, so hold to three where possible; a phone field costs ~5%, a company-size dropdown ~8% but +34% lead quality, a job-title field ~3% but +18% quality - state the trade when you keep one. Social proof lifts SaaS conversion ~10-270% (median ~37%), and a specific testimonial ("saved us 4 hours a week") beats a generic one.

## Inputs

3. Ask: "What is the page goal?" (lead capture, product launch, signup, waitlist, demo request)
4. Ask: "What is the primary offer?" (free trial, demo, download, newsletter, early access)
5. Ask: "What are the top 2-3 objections prospects raise about your product?"

## Process

6. Read `.agents/product-context.md` to pull brand voice, ICP, design preferences (primary color, style), and value proposition.
7. Design the page structure. **Build to a proper landing-page anatomy, then order it for the goal - do not ship a loose stack of sections.**

   **The canonical high-converting structure**, top to bottom, adapted to the goal and to what the market research showed:
   1. **Hero** - an outcome headline (what the buyer gets, not what the product is), a one-line subhead (how, and for whom), one primary CTA, a product visual or screenshot, and a trust strip (logos or a star rating). Everything that decides the click sits in the first viewport.
   2. **Problem / stakes** - name the pain in the buyer's words, so they feel understood before you pitch.
   3. **Solution / how it works** - the mechanism in three steps, so the promise reads as credible rather than magic.
   4. **Benefits** - three to four outcome-led blocks (what changes for them), never a feature list wearing benefit labels.
   5. **Social proof** - specific testimonials that name the objection they answer ("saved us 4 hours a week"), case-study links, review count, recognisable logos - placed next to the decision, not only in the hero.
   6. **Features / detail** - only where the buyer needs specifics to decide (specs, integrations, plans).
   7. **Objections / FAQ** - the four to five real objections the user named, answered plainly.
   8. **Risk reversal** - the guarantee, free trial, or no-card-required line that removes the last hesitation.
   9. **Final CTA** - the same single ask, restated, with genuine urgency only if the offer supports it.
   10. **Minimal footer** - a landing page strips the site nav; every extra link is a leak off the one action.

   **Load-bearing principles for the structure:** one page, one goal, one primary CTA repeated (not competing asks); remove global navigation; message-match the ad or email that brought them (the headline continues the promise they clicked); above-the-fold clarity and an F-pattern reading order; mobile-first, since most traffic is mobile.

   **Order it for the goal:**
   - Lead capture: Hero → Social Proof → Benefits → Testimonials → CTA
   - Product launch: Hero → Problem → Solution → Features → Pricing → CTA
   - Signup/waitlist: Hero → Benefits → Social Proof → FAQ → CTA
   - For other page types (pricing, comparison, waitlist, free tool), refer to the reference file for page-type structures.
   Whatever the order, keep the anatomy above intact and justify any section you drop.
8. Write complete copy for each section:
   - **Hero**: Headline (under 10 words), subheadline (1-2 sentences), primary CTA button text, social proof line (e.g., "Trusted by 500+ teams")
   - **Benefits**: 3-4 benefit blocks, each with icon placeholder, title, and one-sentence description
   - **Social proof**: Testimonial placeholders with role/company format, logo bar placeholder
   - **Features**: 3-6 feature descriptions if applicable
   - **FAQ**: 4-5 questions and answers addressing common objections
   - **Final CTA**: Urgency-driven headline, CTA button text, risk-reversal line
9. Generate prototype HTML with Tailwind CSS:
   - Use the primary color from product context. Use Tailwind arbitrary value syntax (e.g., bg-[#FF5733]) for non-standard brand colors.
   - Mobile-responsive layout
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Placeholder images with descriptive alt text
   - Form with appropriate fields for the offer type
   - Use the Tailwind CDN script (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`) for preview only. This is not production-safe: no class purging, no minification, a much larger payload than a compiled build. State this limitation directly in the output next to the HTML, and tell the user that shipping to production requires compiling Tailwind through the Tailwind CLI, PostCSS, or the build step of whatever framework hosts the page (Next.js, Vite, or similar) instead of the CDN script.
10. Recommend one A/B test (headline, CTA text, or page layout).

## Output

11. Deliver the landing page spec:

- **Page Structure**: Ordered list of sections with one-line rationale for each section's placement
- **Copy**: Full copy for every section listed in step 8. Output each section's copy with headers, not just a summary. Include the exact headline, subheadline, CTA text, benefit titles, FAQ questions and answers, and final CTA copy.
- **HTML Output**: Complete, self-contained prototype HTML in a code block (```html) using the Tailwind CDN script for preview. Output the full HTML inline, do not write it to a file. Immediately beneath the code block, state plainly that this is prototype-ready, not production-deployable as-is, and name the real build step needed before production (Tailwind CLI, PostCSS, or the hosting framework's build pipeline).
- **Performance Targets**: Page load target (<3s), Core Web Vitals targets (LCP, CLS, INP) from the reference file
- **A/B Test Recommendation**: What to test, hypothesis, expected impact

## Chain with

End by naming what runs next, in one line:

- `ab-test` test the new page against the one running now
- `tone-of-voice` run this FIRST if you have no voice profile, otherwise the copy is generic

Say it as **Next:** followed by that skill.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


12. Before returning the output, verify:
- Does the emitted markup meet the accessibility floor: no meaning by colour alone, 4.5:1 text
  contrast, real labels on every input, visible focus states, semantic landmarks with one h1, and alt
  text on every image?
- Does every quantified claim trace to a Proof Points row in the context file, with anything
  unavailable written as [PROOF NEEDED: <claim>] rather than softened into a vague outcome, and is any
  internal-only figure kept out of prospect-facing copy?

- Is the expected traffic source stated, with any target or comparison rate qualified by it rather than
  by industry alone?
- Does every quoted rate carry its traffic source, offer type, and what counts as a conversion on this
  page?
- Was the field list minimised first, with every remaining field justified as needed before the first
  human conversation, and enrichment preferred over asking for company, size or industry?
- Is social proof placed within visual proximity of the form rather than only in the hero or footer?
- Is the proof specific (a named customer with a number, or a testimonial naming the objection it
  answers) rather than a decorative logo grid?
- Is the hero headline under 10 words?
- Does the FAQ section have 4-5 questions that address the objections the user actually named, not generic FAQs?
- Are testimonials and logos clearly labeled as placeholders rather than presented as real customer names?
- Does the section order match the stated page goal (lead capture, product launch, or signup/waitlist), not a default template order?
- Does the output next to the HTML flag the CDN Tailwind script as prototype-only and name the real build step needed before production?

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.
