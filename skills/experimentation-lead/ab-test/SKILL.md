# The Hypothesis Engine

Designs a runnable experiment: the hypothesis stated so that it can actually fail, the variants, Bayesian allocation with Thompson sampling, guardrail metrics, a holdout, required sample size and duration, explicit exit criteria, and the validity threats that would invalidate the read.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
Check `.agents/product-context.md` first so you never ask for something already recorded there.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **Settle the minimum detectable effect before sizing anything.** Sample size is a function of the
> effect you are willing to chase, so asking for it first prevents the common outcome: a twenty-week
> test powered to detect a lift too small to justify shipping. Ask what improvement would actually
> change a decision, and if the honest answer is a large one, the test gets much cheaper. Where the MDE
> implies a runtime longer than the decision can wait for, say the test is not viable and name the
> alternatives, a bigger change with a bigger expected effect, a proxy metric closer to the
> intervention, or a decision made without a test and reviewed later.


> **Vocabulary:** Use "Experience" throughout, not "experiment" or "A/B test." This matches Intempt product terminology. When the reference file uses "experiment," translate to "experience" in all output.

## Context

1. Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing, ask the user to run `/gtm:product-context` first. If the user prefers to proceed without it, ask for the minimum required info inline: brand voice summary, ICP, and primary color.
2. Read `references/bayesian-testing.md` for statistical design patterns and Thompson sampling details.
2a. Read that file's **Validity Threats** section too. Those checks decide whether a result is
    readable at all, and they belong in the brief up front rather than being discovered after the
    experience has run: a confident number from a broken experience is worse than no number, because
    it gets shipped.

## Inputs

3. Ask: "What do you want to test and why?" Get the change, the metric, and the business reason.
4. Ask: "Is this a content, audience, timing, or channel variant test?"
5. Ask: "What is your approximate daily traffic or send volume for this channel?"

## Process

6. Read `.agents/product-context.md` to pull the north star metric and current baselines.
7. Formulate the hypothesis: "If [change], then [metric] will [direction] by [magnitude] because [mechanism]."
8. Define variants: control and one or more treatments. Describe what differs in each.
9. Select assignment strategy. Recommend Thompson sampling for most cases; fixed-allocation for simple two-variant tests.
10. Calculate statistical design:
    - Baseline conversion rate (from product context or user input)
    - Minimum detectable effect (MDE): Use the sample size quick reference table from the reference file to show what sample sizes different MDE choices require.
    - Required sample size per variant
    - Estimated duration based on traffic
    - Confidence threshold: Refer to the confidence threshold tiers in the reference file to recommend the appropriate level.
11. Define guardrails: metrics that must NOT degrade (e.g., unsubscribe rate, error rate).
12. Set exit criteria, when to stop: confidence threshold reached, max duration hit, or guardrail
    violated. State the primary metric explicitly and declare it as the only metric that can decide
    the outcome: secondary metrics explain and catch harm, they never promote a loss to a win, and a
    guardrail breach is decisive against shipping but can never justify shipping.
12a. Specify the validity checks that must pass before the result is read, from the reference file:

    - **Sample ratio mismatch.** How the observed exposures per variant will be compared against the
      configured allocation, and who checks it. Where Thompson sampling is the assignment strategy,
      the comparison is against what the allocator *intended* per period, not against an even split,
      since adaptive allocation is supposed to be uneven and a naive check will always look
      mismatched. If the platform cannot report intended allocation, say SRM is unverifiable here and
      record that as a limit on the verdict rather than skipping it.
    - **Comparison count.** If more than one treatment runs against control, note that the evidence
      threshold has to account for the number of comparisons rather than being applied repeatedly at
      the level set for one.
    - **Pre-declared segments.** Any segment the experience is meant to read separately is named now,
      before traffic starts, and powered for. Segments found later are hypotheses for a next
      experience, not findings from this one.
    - **Minimum duration of one full business cycle (7 days floor)**, so weekday effects are not read
      as treatment effects, regardless of how fast the sample size is reached. Two cycles is the more
      defensible default for anything informing a real decision, since one cycle can simply be an
      unusual week.
    - **The stopping rule, written down before launch.** Not an intention to be disciplined: a rule.
      Per the reference file, stopping on interim significance inflates the false-positive rate from a
      nominal 5% to roughly **25-30%**, so a result read at "95% confidence" after repeated looks is
      nearer 70-75% and nothing in the output reveals it. This is why so many winning tests fail to
      replicate.
    - **Whether the platform's results are anytime-valid or fixed-horizon.** Sequential and
      anytime-valid methods widen the threshold to account for repeated looks, and peeking is then
      legitimate. Fixed-horizon results are not. If nobody can answer which this is, treat it as
      fixed-horizon and do not read it early.
    - **For Thompson sampling specifically:** adaptive allocation does not license unlimited peeking.
      A posterior read repeatedly against a fixed threshold ("P(best) > 95%", checked daily) has the
      same inflated-error problem under a different name, and adaptive allocation makes it worse,
      because the split has already been skewed toward whatever was winning first. Use a pre-set
      posterior or expected-loss threshold **with a minimum-exposure floor and a stated maximum
      duration**, and record which of the two ended the experience.
12b. State what happens if the result is flat. The default for inconclusive is **do not ship**, and
    the finding is reported as "no effect larger than the MDE was detected" rather than "no
    difference". If the user intends to ship regardless on strategic grounds, that is legitimate and
    gets recorded as a decision made on other grounds, not as a result.
13. Specify holdout if measuring incremental lift beyond the experience itself.

## Output

14. Deliver the experience brief:

- **Hypothesis**: Structured if/then/because statement
- **Variants Table**: Columns: Variant | Description | Key Change
- **Statistical Design**: Assignment strategy, primary metric, MDE, sample size per variant, estimated duration, confidence threshold
- **Guardrails**: Metrics that must not degrade, with thresholds
- **Exit Criteria**: Conditions to stop early (win, loss, or inconclusive)
- **Holdout**: Percentage and measurement plan (if applicable)
- **Validity Checks**: the SRM comparison method (against intended allocation where assignment is
  adaptive) and who runs it, the comparison count and its effect on the evidence threshold, the
  pre-declared segments, and the minimum duration in business cycles
- **Decision Framework**: What action to take for each possible outcome, including the flat case,
  where the default is not to ship and the result is stated as no effect larger than the MDE

## Chain with

End by naming what runs next, in one line:

- `website-personalization` ship the winner as a permanent rule instead of ending the test

Say it as **Next:** followed by that skill.

## Quick mode

**Quick mode is the default for a first pass.** Full mode is the Bayesian design with priors,
power and a stopping rule, and it reads like a research paper to someone who wanted to know whether
to bother.

Quick mode: the hypothesis written so it can fail, the one metric that decides it, the minimum
sample per variant, and roughly how long that takes at their traffic. Four lines. Offer full mode
after, and only run it if they say yes or the decision is expensive or hard to reverse.

State the mode you ran in, in the first two lines, so nobody mistakes a rough read for a full one.
The rest of the method in `references/house-rules.md` rule 8 applies.

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


15. Before returning the output, verify:
- Was the minimum detectable effect established before sample size, and where the implied runtime
  exceeds the decision window, is the test called non-viable with alternatives named?

- Does the output say "Experience" throughout, with no leftover "experiment" or "A/B test" surviving from the reference file's own wording?
- Is the hypothesis structured as if/then/because, with a real mechanism stated, not just a direction?
- Does the sample size and duration trace to the MDE and confidence threshold actually chosen, not a generic estimate?
- Does at least one guardrail metric appear, and does the exit criteria cover all three cases (win, loss, inconclusive)?
- Does the baseline conversion rate, MDE, and sample size come from product context or the user's actual input, with no invented statistical assumption? If a number the calculation needs wasn't provided, is it flagged as an assumption needing the user's real number rather than presented as fact?
- Is a sample ratio mismatch check specified with an owner, and where assignment is adaptive, is it
  defined against intended allocation per period rather than an even split? If the platform cannot
  report intended allocation, is that recorded as a limit on the verdict rather than omitted?
- Is exactly one primary metric declared as decisive, with secondary metrics explicitly unable to
  promote a loss to a win, and a guardrail breach able only to stop a ship?
- If more than one treatment runs, does the brief address the comparison count rather than applying a
  single-comparison threshold repeatedly?
- Are any segments to be read separately declared in advance and powered for, with a statement that
  segments discovered later are hypotheses rather than results?
- Is a minimum duration of one full business cycle (7 days floor) set, independent of how quickly the
  sample size is reached, with two cycles used where the decision warrants it?
- Is a stopping rule written down before launch, rather than an intention not to peek? Interim stopping
  takes the false-positive rate from 5% to roughly 25-30%, and the output does not reveal it.
- Is it stated whether the platform's results are anytime-valid or fixed-horizon, with fixed-horizon
  assumed when nobody can answer?
- For Thompson sampling: is the threshold paired with a minimum-exposure floor and a maximum duration,
  and is it recorded which of the two ended the experience? A posterior checked daily against a fixed
  threshold is peeking under another name.
- Does the decision framework cover the flat case with a do-not-ship default, stating the finding as
  no effect larger than the MDE rather than as no difference?

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.
