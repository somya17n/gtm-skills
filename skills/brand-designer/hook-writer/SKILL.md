description: "Takes a LinkedIn post draft and generates four scored hook variants for the opening one or two lines before the see-more cutoff, each built on a distinct psychological framework, with a recommendation and the reason it wins. Use when a post's opening feels flat, or when testing hooks before publishing. Boundary: LinkedIn post openings only. `cold-email` does the equivalent job for cold email subject lines, and `cold-email` writes the opening line of a cold email body."

# The Hook Lab

Generate four hook variants for a LinkedIn post and recommend the strongest one. The hook is the first 1-2 lines before LinkedIn's "see more" cutoff. If it does not stop the scroll, the rest of the post does not matter.

> **Copy standard.** Read `references/outbound-copy-standards.md` before writing, and check
> what you return against its numbered checklist. It sets the awareness-stage calibration, the
> promise-continuity rule, the opening-line specificity test, the proof ladder, and the one-ask
> rule for every line of copy this pack produces. Its checks are additional to this skill's own.

## Before you write

**Run the input list below before you write anything. If one of those inputs is missing, ask for
it and stop. Do not return a draft with a warning on it.**
The user copies the draft and leaves the warning behind, so a caveat protects you and not them.
**Ask at most THREE questions. Hard cap.** Before anything becomes a question, get it yourself:
read `.agents/product-context.md`, fetch the site or page they named, compute it from numbers they
already gave, or look up the platform default. Whatever is left after that, and everything past the
third question, becomes a stated assumption the user corrects in one word rather than a question
that stops the work. Number them, and say what you will assume if one goes unanswered.
Check `.agents/product-context.md` first so you never ask for something already recorded there.

**Write it the way you would say it.** Read `references/house-rules.md` and apply it to everything
you return: answer first, ordinary words, short sentences, top three rather than all fourteen, no
em dashes. Its nine-question check, quality plus safety, runs on your output in addition to this skill's own.

## Constraints

> **State the character budget you are writing to.** LinkedIn truncates at roughly 210 characters on
> desktop and nearer 140 on mobile, and mobile is the majority of feed consumption, so a hook that
> survives on desktop and gets cut on mobile is a failed hook. Write to the mobile budget, give the
> character count of every variant, and mark any that only clears the desktop cutoff.

## Context

1. **If `.agents/product-context.md` does not exist, build it yourself. Do not tell the user to go
and run another skill first.** Read their website and public sources for positioning, ICP, the offer
and tiers, brand voice, proof points and competitors. Ask only for what research genuinely cannot
establish, inside your three-question budget. Then write what you learned to
`.agents/product-context.md` so the next skill does not repeat the work, and say in one line that
you created it and what you inferred rather than observed. The parts this skill needs most are the target persona and brand voice, including the banned-word list.
2. Read `.agents/product-context.md` for the target persona and brand voice, including the banned-word list. Any input below that these already cover is usually recorded there: pull it and confirm with the user rather than asking them to restate it.
3. The banned-word list in that file is binding on every line of copy this skill returns, not advisory.

## How to run

Ask the user for:
1. The full post draft (paste the text), or at minimum the topic and angle
2. Their target audience (job title, industry)
3. Whether they have past post performance data to weight against (optional: if not provided, variants are ranked on framework fit only, not fabricated engagement predictions)

## Output format

Four variants, one per framework:

**1. Curiosity Gap**: [hook text]
Leaves a specific question the reader has to keep reading to answer.

**2. Pattern Interrupt**: [hook text]
Breaks the reader's expected take on the topic.

**3. Specific Stat**: [hook text]
Leads with a real number pulled from the draft or the user's input, never a fabricated statistic.
**If the input contains no number, do not write this variant.** Say so in one line and replace it
with a second Curiosity Gap or Contrarian variant. Inventing a plausible industry statistic to fill
the slot is the single worst thing this skill can do, because it looks researched and is not.

**4. Contrarian Stance**: [hook text]
A direct, polarizing point of view stated in one line.

For each: one line on why it fits this audience, and a flag if the hook promises something the post body does not actually deliver (a rug-pull hook: cut regardless of how strong it tests).

**Recommended pick:** [hook]. One sentence on why, and which of the remaining three to A/B test against it.

## Rules for the variants

- First line must work standalone if LinkedIn truncates the rest: no hook that depends on line 2 to make sense
- No clickbait, no engagement-bait phrasing ("this changed everything"), no all-caps
- Every hook must be grounded in something actually in the post body or the user's input: do not invent a stat, event, or claim to make the hook stronger
- If the user supplied past performance data, prioritize the framework that data shows works best for their audience over the default ranking

## Quality check before returning

**Scope of these checks.** Two rules before you run them, because testing found both failures in
most skills in this pack:

- **A check you cannot answer from the inputs you asked for is conditional, not skippable.** If it
  needs data the Inputs section never collects, run it only when the user happened to supply that
  data. Otherwise say the check did not run and name the input it needed. Never skip it silently,
  and never invent the data to make it pass. Inventing is the likelier failure and the worse one.
- **Every figure stated in this skill's own instructions is a pack benchmark, not the user's
  number.** Label it inline as such wherever it reaches the output, or replace it with
  `[NEED: source]` if it is doing real work in a decision and no source exists. House rules 4b and
  4c have the full version.


Before returning the output, verify:
- Does every variant show its character count against the mobile truncation budget, with
  desktop-only-safe variants marked?

- Does every hook stand alone if LinkedIn truncates after line 1, with no dependency on line 2?
- Is every stat or claim in a hook actually present in the post body or the user's input, not invented to make it punchier?
- Was every hook checked for the rug-pull flag (promising something the post body doesn't deliver), and cut if it failed regardless of how strong it tested?
- If the user supplied past performance data, did the recommended pick actually follow that data instead of the default framework ranking?
- Is the "Specific Stat" variant's number real, not a fabricated engagement prediction?

If any check fails, correct it before returning the output.


## Chain with

End by naming what runs next, in one line:

- `tone-of-voice` check the winning hook against the brand voice before it publishes
- `cold-email` if this was for email, not LinkedIn

Say it as **Next:** followed by the one skill that matters most here.
